	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions f:R(+)-R(+) such that f(f(x))=6x-f(x) for all real x.\end{tcolorbox}

Let $ a > 0$ and $ b = f(a)$ and let $ x_n$ be the sequence defined as :

$ x_0 = a$, $ x_1 = b$ and $ x_{n + 2} = - x_{n + 1} + 6x_n$ such that we get $ x_{n + 1} = f(x_n)$

Direct resolution of the sequence gives $ x_n = \frac {2a - b}5( - 3)^n + \frac {3a + b}52^n$

If $ 2a - b > 0$ then  $ x_{2n + 1} =f(x_{2n})  < 0$ for $ n$ great enough and this is impossible since $ f(x)$ is from $ \mathbb R^ + \to\mathbb R^ +$
If $ 2a - b < 0$ then  $ x_{2n}=f(x_{2n-1}) < 0$ for $ n$ great enough and this is impossible since $ f(x)$ is from $ \mathbb R^ + \to\mathbb R^ +$

So $ b = 2a$ and so $ f(x) = 2x$, which indeed is a solution.

Hence the answer : $ \boxed{f(x) = 2x}$ $ \forall x$

Let $f(x)=g(x+1)+x-\frac 32$ and equation becomes $3g(2(x+1))=g(x+1)$ and so $3g(2x)=g(x)$

Continuity implies then $g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x-\frac 32}$

	Let's start a marathon on functional equations:
When you solve a problem, you should post a new one.

Here's problem 1:
Find all functions $f: \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ that satisfy:
$f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ $\forall x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ and
$f(x^2) = f(x)^2$ $\forall x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Let's start a marathon on functional equations:
When you solve a problem, you should post a new one.

\begin{bolded}Problem 1:\end{bolded} Find all functions $f: \mathbb{Q}_{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}_{+}$ that satisfy:

(1).$f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ $\ ,\ \forall x \in \mathbb{Q}_{+}$ and

(2).$f(x^2) = f(x)^2$ $\ ,\ \forall x \in \mathbb{Q}_{+}$.\end{tcolorbox}

I like this idea :)

[hide="Problem 1"]From (1), we can easily find by induction that $f(x+n)=f(x)+n\ ,\ (\forall)x\in \mathbb{Q}_+\ ,\ (\forall)n\in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore by (2) we have:

\[f((x+n)^2)=f^2(x+n)\Leftrightarrow f(x^2+2nx+n^2)=(f(x)+n)^2\Leftrightarrow\]

\[ f(x^2+2nx)+n^2=f^2(x)+2nf(x)+n^2\Leftrightarrow f(x^2+2nx)=f^2(x)+2nf(x)\]

Now let's put $x=\displaystyle\frac{p}{q}\ ,\ p,q\in \mathbb{N}^*$ and let $n\rightarrow q$

\[\Rightarrow f\left(\frac{p^2}{q^2}+2p\right)=f^2\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)+2qf\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\Leftrightarrow \]

\[f\left(\frac{p^2}{q^2}\right)+2p=f\left(\frac{p^2}{q^2}\right)+2qf\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\]

So $f\left(\displaystyle\frac{p}{q}\right)=\displaystyle\frac{p}{q}$. So $f(x)=x\ ,\ (\forall)x\in \mathbb{Q}_+$ which verifies the initial equation.[\/hide]

\begin{bolded}Problem 2:\end{bolded} Determine all the functions $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:

\[f(x^3)-f(y^3)=(x^2+xy+y^2)(f(x)-f(y))\ ,\ (\forall)x,y\in \mathbb{R}\]

 [hide="Problem 2"]WLOG assume $f(0)=0$ (otherwise let $F(x)= f(x)-f(0)$ then you can easily see that it works in equation!) .

Now put $y=0$ , we get $f(x^3) =(x^2)f(x)$ . Substitute in the main equation we get $f(x)=xf(1)$.

So the answer is $f(x)=xf(1) + f(0)$[\/hide]

	$x=y=0$ yields $f(0)=0$.
$x=0$ yields $f(y^3)=yf(y^2)$, so the given functional equation reduces to:
$f(x^3+y^3)=f(x^3)+f(y^3)$.
Setting $a=x^3$, $b=y^3$ gives:
$f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)$, which is a Cauchy-equation with solutions:
$f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=cx$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$.
So we have two possible functions:
$f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=cx$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and a quick check tells us that both functions satisfy.

New problem:
find all functions $f: \mathbb{R}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
$f(x+y)-f(y) = \frac{x}{y(x+y)}$

Dont hesitate to post here the official general form for the infinitely many solutions when you'll get it :)\end{tcolorbox}

Let's consider the functions

$ p_n(x) = (\sin x + \cos x)^n - \sin^n x - \cos^n x$.

Now, $ f(x) = \sum a_k x^k$ is a solution iff $ \sum a_k p_k(x) = 0$.

Lemma: Every symmetric polynomial $ P(a, b)$ can be written as a polynomial in $ ab, a + b$.

Now, since $ p_n(x)$ is a symmetric polynomial in $ \sin x, \cos x$ and since $ \sin x \cos x = \frac {(\sin x + \cos x)^2 - 1}{2}$, it follows that $ p_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $ n$ in $ u = \sin x + \cos x$ (except when $ n = 1$, in which case $ p_1(x) = 0$.)

Note that $ u$ takes on every value in $ [ - \sqrt {2}, \sqrt {2} ]$. It follows that if $ \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k p_k(x) = 0$ then the corresponding polynomial in $ u$ must be identically zero, but since $ p_n(x)$ is the only term of degree $ n$ this is not possible unless $ n = 1$.

Hence the only solution is $ f(x) = \boxed{ax}$.

Just define $f(x)$ as :

Here is a new problem : 
Let $f:\mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$. Find all functions $f$ such that 
$$f(f(x)+2y) = 10x + f(f(y)-3x)$$

$$f(f(x)+2y) = 10x + f(f(y)-3x)$$\end{tcolorbox}
Mmmmm........
[hide=solution]Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion.
Clearly,$f(x)+2y=f(y)-3x\implies x=0--------------------(1)$
Now,$P\left(x,\frac{a-f(x)}{2}\right)\implies f(a)-10x=f\left(f\left(\frac{a-f(x)}{2}\right)-3x\right)$ which implies that $f(x)$ is surjective.
Let call the above equation $Q(a,x)$
If $f(a)=f(b)\exists a\ne b$
Then $Q(2a+f(x),x),Q(2b+f(x),x)\implies f(2a+f(x))=f(2b+f(x))$,but since $f(x)$ is surjective,this implies that $f(x)$ is periodic.
Let $f(x)=f(x+c)\forall x$ for some constant $c\ne 0$
Then $(1),f\left(\frac{2c}{5}\right)+2\left(-\frac{3c}{5}\right)=f\left(-\frac{3c}{5}\right)-3\left(\frac{2c}{5}\right)\implies \frac{2c}{5}=0\implies c=0$,contradiction.Hence $f(x)$ is bijective.
Finally,$P(0,x)\implies f(0)+2x=f(x)\implies\boxed{f(x)=2x+c}\text{ for some constant } c$ which clearly satisfied the equation.[\/hide]

With continuity constraint, it's quite easy to establish $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ or $f(x)=x+a$ $\forall x$

But since this is a real olympiad exercise you got in a real exam (isn't it ?) and since this real exercise did not contain continuity constraint, there is surely an olympiad level solution not demanding continuity.

Let $g(x)=f(x)+1-x$ so that equation becomes $g(x(g(y)+y))=g(x)$

If $g(y)+y=1$ $\forall y$, we get $\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution
If $g(y)+y=0$ $\forall y$, we get $f(x)=-1$ $\forall x$ which is not a solution
If $g(y)+y=-1$ $\forall y$, we get $f(x)=-2$ $\forall x$ which is not a solution
Else, continuity implies $\exists u,v$ such that $g(u)+u=v\notin\{-1,0,1\}$

Then we get $g(vx)=g(x)$ and so $g(v^nx)=g(x)$ $\forall x,\forall n\in\mathbb Z$
Setting then $n\to+\infty$ or $n\to-\infty$ and using again continuity, we get $g(x)=g(0)$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x+a}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

Is this the exact exercice you got in your olympiad contest or training session ? (it's a little bit different that the one you asked me in pm).

Without any restriction on $a,b,c$ this implies huge discussion depending on values of $a,b,c$ and some strange solutions.

For, exemple, with $(a,b,c)=(1,1,0)$ we get a continuous solution $f(x)=sign(x)\min(|x|,\sin\frac{\pi |x|}2)$ and infinitely many other functions ...

So I'm surprised that such a general problem occured in a real olympiad contest or training session.

I saw the two private function
1. \[f(f(x))=f(x)+x\] (math contest)
2. \[f(f(x))=f(x)+2x\] (Belarusia 1998)
and I asked the general above
\end{solution}

Here is a rather quick answer to your general question.

(I hope that if you encounter a problem "solve in $\mathbb Z$ equation $x+17=3$" and another problem "solve in $\mathbb R$ equation $x^2+2x+1=0$", you will not ask in the forum, claiming that it is a real olympiad exercise : "solve in $\mathbb C$ equation $\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k$ where $a_i\in\mathbb C$" just in order to get a general solution to all your polynomial equation exercises :( )


\begin{bolded}Some personal comments\end{underlined}\end{bolded} :
I did not check all the typos (too tiring) and I hope you'll excuse them
I dont claim that all my proofs are the shortest.
Maybe some subcases could have been merged.
Subcase 7.2 is not finished. It seems to me that it is one of the most complex and it has infinitely many solutions.
Your two examples in previous posts both are in subcase 7.1.1
Some subcases was full independant questions in this forum (for example $f(f(x))=x$ is subcase 5.3 and $f(x)+f^{-1}(x)=2x$ is subcase 7.3.2)

I hope you'll read this post line per line.



\begin{bolded}Case 1\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a=b=c=0$ : any continuous function is solution

\begin{bolded}Case 2\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a=b=0$ and $c\ne 0$ : no solution

\begin{bolded}Case 3\end{underlined} \end{bolded}: If $a=0$ and $b\ne 0$ : unique solution is $f(x)=-\frac cbx$ $\forall x$

\begin{bolded}Case 4\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a\ne 0$ and $b=c=0$, equation is $f(f(x))=0$ and so $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in f(\mathbb R)$ and, since continuous, $f(\mathbb R)$ is an interval and so :

Let $h(x)$ any continuous surjection from $(-\infty,a]to(a,+\infty)$ such that $h(a)=0$
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x<a$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\ge a$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 4.4 \end{bolded}: $f(\mathbb R)=(-\infty,a]$. with $a\ge 0$ (since obviously $0\inf(\mathbb R)$
Then we get infinitely many solutions :
Let $a\ge 0$
Let $h(x)$ any continuous surjection from $[a,+\infty)to(-\infty,a]$ such that $h(a)=0$
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x>a$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\le a$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 4.5\end{bolded} : $f(\mathbb R)=(-\infty,a)$. with $a>0$ (since obviously $0\inf(\mathbb R)$
Then we get infinitely many solutions :
Let $a>0$
Let $h(x)$ any continuous surjection from $[a,+\infty)to(-\infty,a)$ such that $h(a)=0$

Then we get infinitely many solutions :
Let $a\le 0\le b$
Let $h(x)$ any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $h(\mathbb R\setminus(a,b))=[a,b]$ and $h(a)=h(b)=0$.
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x\notin[a,b]$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in[a,b]$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 4.7\end{bolded} : $f(\mathbb R)=[a,b)$ with $a\le 0< b$ (since obviously $0\inf(\mathbb R)$
Then we get infinitely many solutions :
Let $a\le 0< b$
Let $h(x)$ any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $hf(\mathbb R\setminus(a,b))=[a,b)$ and $h(a)=h(b)=0$.
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x\notin[a,b]$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in[a,b]$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 4.8\end{bolded} : $f(\mathbb R)=(a,b]$ with $a< 0\le b$ (since obviously $0\inf(\mathbb R)$
Then we get infinitely many solutions :
Let $a< 0\le b$
Let $h(x)$ any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $h(\mathbb R\setminus(a,b))=(a,b]$ and $h(a)=h(b)=0$.
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x\notin[a,b]$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in[a,b]$

Let $h(x)$ any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $h(\mathbb R\setminus(a,b))=(a,b)$ and $h(a)=h(b)=0$.
Then $f(x)=h(x)$ $\forall x\notin[a,b]$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in[a,b]$

\begin{bolded}Case 5\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a\ne 0$ and $b=0$ and $c\ne 0$, equation is $f(f(x))=tx$ with $t=\frac ca\ne 0$
So $f(x)$ is bijective and so, since continuous, monotonous.
So $f(f(x))$ is an increasing function.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 5.1\end{bolded} : If $t<0$ ($\iff ac<0$) then  no solution since $LHS$ is increasing while RHS is decreasing

\begin{bolded}Subcase 5.2\end{bolded} : if $1>t>0$ ($\iff$ $a>c>0$ or $a<c<0$), this is a classical equation with infinitely many solutions which may be built piece par piece.

\begin{bolded}Case 6\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a\ne 0$ and $b=\ne 0$ and $c=0$, equation is $f(f(x))=tf(x)$ with $t=\frac ba\ne 0$
So $f(x)=tx$ $\forall x\in f(\mathbb R)$

So no solution

\begin{bolded}Subcase 6.9.1\end{bolded} : if $t\ge 1$, then $a< ta<b$ and $a< tb< b$ imply no solution

\begin{bolded}Subcase 6.9.2\end{bolded} : if $1>t>0$, then $a< ta<b$ and $a< tb< b$ imply $a< 0< b$ and :
Let $a< 0< b$
Let $h(x)$ be any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to(a,b)$ such that :
$h(a)=ta$
$h(b)=tb$
$(a,ta]\cup[tb,b)\subseteq h((-\infty,a]\cup[b,+\infty))$
Then :
$\forall x\in[a,b]$ : $f(x)=tx$
$\forall x\notin[a,b]$ : $f(x)=h(x)$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 6.9.3\end{bolded} : if $-1< t<0$, then $a< ta<b$ and $a< tb< b$ imply $a< 0$ and $\frac at> b> ta$ and :
Let $a<0$ and $b\in(ta,\frac at)$
Let $h(x)$ be any continuous function from $\mathbb R\to(a,b)$ such that :
$h(a)=ta$
$h(b)=tb$
$(a,tb]\cup[ta,b)\subseteq h((-\infty,a]\cup[b,+\infty))$
Then :
$\forall x\in[a,b]$ : $f(x)=tx$
$\forall x\notin[a,b]$ : $f(x)=h(x)$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 6.9.4\end{bolded} : if $t\le -1$, then $a< ta<b$ and $a< tb< b$ imply no solution


\begin{bolded}Case  7\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : $a,b,c\ne 0$ and the equation is $f(f(x))=uf(x)+vx$ with $u,v\ne 0$

$f(x)$ is injective and so, since continuous, monotonous.
If $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=L$, then setting $x\to+\infty$ in functional equation and using continuity gives contradiction
So $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=\pm\infty$
If $\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=L$, then setting $x\to-\infty$ in functional equation and using continuity gives contradiction
So $\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\pm\infty$

And since $f(x)$ is monotonous, we get that $f(\mathbb R)=\mathbb R$ and so $f(x)$ is a bijection.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1\end{bolded} : $v>0$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $v>0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has two distinct real roots $r_1>0>r_2$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=\frac{(f(x)-r_2x)r_1^n-(f(x)-r_1x)r_2^n}{r_1-r_2}$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1.1\end{bolded} : $u+v\ne 1$ 
$u+v\ne 1$ $\implies$ $r_1\ne 1$
$u\ne 0$ $\implies$ $r_2\ne -r_1$

If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $r$, then functional equation implies $r=ur+vr$ and so $r=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$\Delta_n(x)=$ $\frac{(f(x)-r_2x)(r_1-1)r_1^{n+1}-(f(x)-r_1x)(r_2-1)r_2^{n+1}}{(f(x)-r_2x)(r_1-1)r_1^{n}-(f(x)-r_1x)(r_2-1)r_2^{n}}$

Let $x\ne 0$ such that $f(x)\ne r_1x$ and $f(x)\ne r_2x$
We know that $|r_1|\ne |r_2|$ and so :
If $|r_1|>|r_2|$ : $\lim_{n\to +\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_1$ and $\lim_{n\to -\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_2$
If $|r_1|<|r_2|$ : $\lim_{n\to +\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_2$ and $\lim_{n\to -\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_1$
In both cases $\Delta_n(x)$ does not have a constant sign.

So $\forall x\ne 0$, either $f(x)=r_1x$, either $f(x)=r_2x$ and continuity + monotonicity imply :
either $f(x)=r_1x$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution
either $f(x)=r_2x$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

Hence two solutons in this subcase

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1.2\end{bolded} : $u+v=1$
So $r_1=1$ and $r_2=u-1=-v<0$
$f(x)=x$ is a solution.
Let us from now in this subcase look for other solutions (different from $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$)

Let then $x$ such that $f(x)\ne x$ : $\frac{f(f(x))-f(x)}{f(x)-x}=-v<0$ and so $f(x)$ must be decreasing.

Since $f(x)$ is continuous and decreasing, then equation $f(x)=x$ has a unique root $r$.
Let then $g(x)=f(x+r)-r$ : it's easy to check that $g(x)$ is such that $g(g(x))=ug(x)+vx$ and $g(0)=0$

So WLOG consider from now that $f(0)=0$ and so $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is decreasing, $f^{n}(x)$ is increasing for even $n$ and decreasing for odd $n$
And since $f^{n}(0)=0$, we can conclude

$\forall x\ne 0$ : $\frac{f^{n}(x)}x$ is nonzero and has same sign as $(-1)^n$

But $\frac{f^{n}(x)}x$ $=\frac{f(x)-r_2x-(f(x)-x)r_2^n}{(1-r_2)x}$

Since $r_2\ne \pm 1$, this quantity has limit  $\frac{f(x)-r_2x}{(1-r_2)x}$ when $n$ is set to $+\infty$ if $|r_2|<1$ or $-\infty$ if $|r_2|>1$
And so $f(x)=r_2x$, else this quantity can no longer has same sign as $(-1)^n$ when $n$ is set to the appropriate $\infty$
So $f(x)=-vx$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution

And so the solutions in this subcase :
$f(x)=x$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=c-vx$ $\forall x$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.2\end{bolded} : $v<0$ and $u^2+4v>0$
\begin{bolded}[color=red]This case need to be developped a bit more[\/color].\end{bolded}
We again obviously have the two solutions $f(x)=r_1x$ and $f(x)=r_2x$, both $r_1,r_2$ having the same sign
But there are in some cases a lot of other solutions.
Look for example at $f(f(x))=5f(x)-6x$ : it's possible to buid piece per piece infinitely many solutions such that for example $f(x)\in(2x,3x)$ $\forall x>0$


\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3 \end{bolded}: $v<0$ and $u^2+4v=0$
\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3.1\end{bolded} : $u\ne 2$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $u^2+4v=0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has one double real root $r=\frac u2\notin\{0,1\}$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=r^{n-1}(nf(x)-r(n-1)x)$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Note that $u^2+4v=0$ and $u\ne 2$ implu $u+v\ne 1$
If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $z$, then functional equation implies $z=uz+vz$ and so $z=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$\Delta_n(x)=$ $r\frac{(n+1)(r-1)(f(x)-rx)+r(f(x)-x)}{n(r-1)(f(x)-rx)+r(f(x)-x)}$

If $f(x)\ne rx$ for some $x\ne 0$, and since $r\ne 1$, we get $(r-1)(f(x)-rx)\ne 0$ and so $\exists n\in\mathbb Z$ such that the two parts of the fraction have opposite signs.
And since, for $n$ great enough, these two parts have same sign, we get that $\Delta_n(x)$ can not have a constant sign.
So $f(x)=rx$ $\forall x$, whch indeed is a solution.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3.2\end{bolded} : $u=2$ and $v=-1$
Equation is $f(f(x))=2f(x)-x$

Writing $g(x)=f(x)-x$, the equation is $g(x+g(x))=g(x)$

$g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution and let us from now look for non all zero solutions.
If $g(x)$ is solution, then $-g(-x)$ is solution too and so Wlog say $g(p)=q>0$ for some $p$

Let $A=\{x\ge p$ such that $g(x)=g(p)=q\}$

From $g(x+g(x))=g(x)$, we get $g(x+ng(x))=g(x)$ and so $p+nq\in A$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$

If $A$ is not dense in $[p,+\infty)$, let then $a,b\in A$ such that $p\le a<b$ and $(a,b)\cap A=\emptyset$. (existence of $a,b$ needs continuity of $g(x)$)

Let then $y\in(a,b)$. So $g(y)\ne q$ 
Consider then $y-a+n(g(y)-q)$ for $n\in\mathbb N$
Since $g(y)\ne q$, this quantity, for $n$ great enough is out of $[-q,+q]$ and so let $m>0$ such that $y-a+m(g(y)-q)\notin[-q,+q]$ and so such that $y+mg(y)\notin[a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q]$

Looking at the continuous function $h(x)=x+mg(x)$, we get :
$h(a)=a+mq\in(a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q)$
$h(y)=y+mg(y)\notin[a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q]$

So (using continuity of $h(x)$), $\exists z\in(a,y)$ such that $h(z)=a+(m-1)q$ or $h(z)=a+(m+1)q$
But then $g(h(z))=q$ and so $g(z+mg(z))=g(z)=q$, impossible since $z\in(a,b)$ and $(a,b)\cap A=\emptyset$.

So $A$ is dense in $[p,+\infty)$

Then continuity of $g(x)$ implies $g(x)=q$ $\forall x\ge p$.
Let then any $w<p$ : If $g(w)>0$, then $\exists n\in\mathbb N$ such that $w+ng(w)>p$ and so $g(w)=q$. So $\forall x<p$ : either $g(x)=q$, either $g(x)\le 0$ and continuity gives the conclusion $g(x)=q$ $\forall x$

So $g(x)=c$ and $f(x)=x+c$ which indeed is a solution.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.4 \end{bolded}: $v<0$ and $u^2+4v<0$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $u^2+4v<0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has two distinct complex roots $re^{it}$ and $re^{-it}$ with $r>0$ and $t\in(0,\pi)$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=r^{n-1}\frac{f(x)\sin nt-rx\sin(n-1)t}{\sin t}$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Note that $u^2+4v<0$ implies $u+v<1$
If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $r$, then functional equation implies $r=ur+vr$ and so $r=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$f^{k+1}(x)-f^{k}(x)$ $=r^{k}\frac{f(x)\sin (k+1)t-rx\sin kt}{\sin t}$ $-r^{k-1}\frac{f(x)\sin kt-rx\sin(k-1)t}{\sin t}$
$=\frac{r^{k-1}}{\sin t}$ $(rf(x)\sin (k+1)t-r^2x\sin kt-f(x)\sin kt+rx\sin(k-1)t)$

$=cr^k\sin(kt+d)$ for some $c\ne 0,d$ depending on $x$

So $\Delta_n(x)=$ $r\frac{\sin (n+1)t+d}{\sin nt+d}$

But this quantity can not be of constant sign $\forall n$ (since $t\in(0,\pi)$)

Hence no solution

Here is a rather quick answer to your general question.

(I hope that if you encounter a problem "solve in $\mathbb Z$ equation $x+17=3$" and another problem "solve in $\mathbb R$ equation $x^2+2x+1=0$", you will not ask in the forum, claiming that it is a real olympiad exercise : "solve in $\mathbb C$ equation $\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k$ where $a_i\in\mathbb C$" just in order to get a general solution to all your polynomial equation exercises :( )


\begin{bolded}Some personal comments\end{underlined}\end{bolded} :
I did not check all the typos (too tiring) and I hope you'll excuse them
I dont claim that all my proofs are the shortest.
Maybe some subcases could have been merged.
Subcase 7.2 is not finished. It seems to me that it is one of the most complex and it has infinitely many solutions.
Your two examples in previous posts both are in subcase 7.1.1
Some subcases was full independant questions in this forum (for example $f(f(x))=x$ is subcase 5.3 and $f(x)+f^{-1}(x)=2x$ is subcase 7.3.2)

I hope you'll read this post line per line.

\begin{bolded}Case  7\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : $a,b,c\ne 0$ and the equation is $f(f(x))=uf(x)+vx$ with $u,v\ne 0$

$f(x)$ is injective and so, since continuous, monotonous.
If $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=L$, then setting $x\to+\infty$ in functional equation and using continuity gives contradiction
So $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=\pm\infty$
If $\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=L$, then setting $x\to-\infty$ in functional equation and using continuity gives contradiction
So $\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\pm\infty$

And since $f(x)$ is monotonous, we get that $f(\mathbb R)=\mathbb R$ and so $f(x)$ is a bijection.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1\end{bolded} : $v>0$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $v>0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has two distinct real roots $r_1>0>r_2$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=\frac{(f(x)-r_2x)r_1^n-(f(x)-r_1x)r_2^n}{r_1-r_2}$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1.1\end{bolded} : $u+v\ne 1$ 
$u+v\ne 1$ $\implies$ $r_1\ne 1$
$u\ne 0$ $\implies$ $r_2\ne -r_1$

If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $r$, then functional equation implies $r=ur+vr$ and so $r=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$\Delta_n(x)=$ $\frac{(f(x)-r_2x)(r_1-1)r_1^{n+1}-(f(x)-r_1x)(r_2-1)r_2^{n+1}}{(f(x)-r_2x)(r_1-1)r_1^{n}-(f(x)-r_1x)(r_2-1)r_2^{n}}$

Let $x\ne 0$ such that $f(x)\ne r_1x$ and $f(x)\ne r_2x$
We know that $|r_1|\ne |r_2|$ and so :
If $|r_1|>|r_2|$ : $\lim_{n\to +\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_1$ and $\lim_{n\to -\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_2$
If $|r_1|<|r_2|$ : $\lim_{n\to +\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_2$ and $\lim_{n\to -\infty}\Delta_n(x)=r_1$
In both cases $\Delta_n(x)$ does not have a constant sign.

So $\forall x\ne 0$, either $f(x)=r_1x$, either $f(x)=r_2x$ and continuity + monotonicity imply :
either $f(x)=r_1x$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution
either $f(x)=r_2x$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

Hence two solutons in this subcase

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.1.2\end{bolded} : $u+v=1$
So $r_1=1$ and $r_2=u-1=-v<0$
$f(x)=x$ is a solution.
Let us from now in this subcase look for other solutions (different from $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$)

Let then $x$ such that $f(x)\ne x$ : $\frac{f(f(x))-f(x)}{f(x)-x}=-v<0$ and so $f(x)$ must be decreasing.

Since $f(x)$ is continuous and decreasing, then equation $f(x)=x$ has a unique root $r$.
Let then $g(x)=f(x+r)-r$ : it's easy to check that $g(x)$ is such that $g(g(x))=ug(x)+vx$ and $g(0)=0$

So WLOG consider from now that $f(0)=0$ and so $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is decreasing, $f^{n}(x)$ is increasing for even $n$ and decreasing for odd $n$
And since $f^{n}(0)=0$, we can conclude

$\forall x\ne 0$ : $\frac{f^{n}(x)}x$ is nonzero and has same sign as $(-1)^n$

But $\frac{f^{n}(x)}x$ $=\frac{f(x)-r_2x-(f(x)-x)r_2^n}{(1-r_2)x}$

Since $r_2\ne \pm 1$, this quantity has limit  $\frac{f(x)-r_2x}{(1-r_2)x}$ when $n$ is set to $+\infty$ if $|r_2|<1$ or $-\infty$ if $|r_2|>1$
And so $f(x)=r_2x$, else this quantity can no longer has same sign as $(-1)^n$ when $n$ is set to the appropriate $\infty$
So $f(x)=-vx$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution

And so the solutions in this subcase :
$f(x)=x$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=c-vx$ $\forall x$

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.2\end{bolded} : $v<0$ and $u^2+4v>0$
\begin{bolded}[color=red]This case need to be developped a bit more[\/color].\end{bolded}
We again obviously have the two solutions $f(x)=r_1x$ and $f(x)=r_2x$, both $r_1,r_2$ having the same sign
But there are in some cases a lot of other solutions.
Look for example at $f(f(x))=5f(x)-6x$ : it's possible to buid piece per piece infinitely many solutions such that for example $f(x)\in(2x,3x)$ $\forall x>0$


\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3 \end{bolded}: $v<0$ and $u^2+4v=0$
\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3.1\end{bolded} : $u\ne 2$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $u^2+4v=0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has one double real root $r=\frac u2\notin\{0,1\}$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=r^{n-1}(nf(x)-r(n-1)x)$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Note that $u^2+4v=0$ and $u\ne 2$ implu $u+v\ne 1$
If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $z$, then functional equation implies $z=uz+vz$ and so $z=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$\Delta_n(x)=$ $r\frac{(n+1)(r-1)(f(x)-rx)+r(f(x)-x)}{n(r-1)(f(x)-rx)+r(f(x)-x)}$

If $f(x)\ne rx$ for some $x\ne 0$, and since $r\ne 1$, we get $(r-1)(f(x)-rx)\ne 0$ and so $\exists n\in\mathbb Z$ such that the two parts of the fraction have opposite signs.
And since, for $n$ great enough, these two parts have same sign, we get that $\Delta_n(x)$ can not have a constant sign.
So $f(x)=rx$ $\forall x$, whch indeed is a solution.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.3.2\end{bolded} : $u=2$ and $v=-1$
Equation is $f(f(x))=2f(x)-x$

Writing $g(x)=f(x)-x$, the equation is $g(x+g(x))=g(x)$

$g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution and let us from now look for non all zero solutions.
If $g(x)$ is solution, then $-g(-x)$ is solution too and so Wlog say $g(p)=q>0$ for some $p$

Let $A=\{x\ge p$ such that $g(x)=g(p)=q\}$

From $g(x+g(x))=g(x)$, we get $g(x+ng(x))=g(x)$ and so $p+nq\in A$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$

If $A$ is not dense in $[p,+\infty)$, let then $a,b\in A$ such that $p\le a<b$ and $(a,b)\cap A=\emptyset$. (existence of $a,b$ needs continuity of $g(x)$)

Let then $y\in(a,b)$. So $g(y)\ne q$ 
Consider then $y-a+n(g(y)-q)$ for $n\in\mathbb N$
Since $g(y)\ne q$, this quantity, for $n$ great enough is out of $[-q,+q]$ and so let $m>0$ such that $y-a+m(g(y)-q)\notin[-q,+q]$ and so such that $y+mg(y)\notin[a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q]$

Looking at the continuous function $h(x)=x+mg(x)$, we get :
$h(a)=a+mq\in(a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q)$
$h(y)=y+mg(y)\notin[a+(m-1)q,a+(m+1)q]$

So (using continuity of $h(x)$), $\exists z\in(a,y)$ such that $h(z)=a+(m-1)q$ or $h(z)=a+(m+1)q$
But then $g(h(z))=q$ and so $g(z+mg(z))=g(z)=q$, impossible since $z\in(a,b)$ and $(a,b)\cap A=\emptyset$.

So $A$ is dense in $[p,+\infty)$

Then continuity of $g(x)$ implies $g(x)=q$ $\forall x\ge p$.
Let then any $w<p$ : If $g(w)>0$, then $\exists n\in\mathbb N$ such that $w+ng(w)>p$ and so $g(w)=q$. So $\forall x<p$ : either $g(x)=q$, either $g(x)\le 0$ and continuity gives the conclusion $g(x)=q$ $\forall x$

So $g(x)=c$ and $f(x)=x+c$ which indeed is a solution.

\begin{bolded}Subcase 7.4 \end{bolded}: $v<0$ and $u^2+4v<0$
let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_{n+2}=ua_{n+1}+va_n$ $\forall n\ge 0$
Notice than $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$
Since $u^2+4v<0$, the characteristic equation $x^2-ux-v$ has two distinct complex roots $re^{it}$ and $re^{-it}$ with $r>0$ and $t\in(0,\pi)$

And so $f^{[n]}(x)=r^{n-1}\frac{f(x)\sin nt-rx\sin(n-1)t}{\sin t}$

Since $f(x)$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}(x)$ exists and it is easy to show that the above expression is true $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Note that $u^2+4v<0$ implies $u+v<1$
If the equation $f(x)=x$ has real root $r$, then functional equation implies $r=ur+vr$ and so $r=0$
So, if $x\ne 0$, $f^{k+1}(x)\ne f^k(x)$ $\forall k$

For $x\ne 0$, we can then define $\Delta_n(x)=\frac{f^{n+2}(x)-f^{n+1}(x)}{f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)}$
$\Delta_n(x)\ne 0$
Since $f(x)$ is monotonous, $\Delta_n(x)$ has a constant sign, for any values of $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $x\in\mathbb R^*$

$f^{k+1}(x)-f^{k}(x)$ $=r^{k}\frac{f(x)\sin (k+1)t-rx\sin kt}{\sin t}$ $-r^{k-1}\frac{f(x)\sin kt-rx\sin(k-1)t}{\sin t}$
$=\frac{r^{k-1}}{\sin t}$ $(rf(x)\sin (k+1)t-r^2x\sin kt-f(x)\sin kt+rx\sin(k-1)t)$

$=cr^k\sin(kt+d)$ for some $c\ne 0,d$ depending on $x$

So $\Delta_n(x)=$ $r\frac{\sin (n+1)t+d}{\sin nt+d}$

But this quantity can not be of constant sign $\forall n$ (since $t\in(0,\pi)$)

Hence no solution\end{tcolorbox}

	\begin{tcolorbox}Determine all surjective functions $f : \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ such that \[f(x+f(y))+f(y+f(x))=f(f(2x)+2y) ,\]

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))+f(y+f(x))=f(f(2x)+2y)$, true $\forall x,y>0$

Comparing $P(\frac x2,\frac y2)$ with $P(\frac y2,\frac x2)$, we get new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x+f(y))=f(y+f(x))$ $\forall x,y>0$

If $f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a>b$, subtracting $Q(a,y)$ from $Q(b,y)$ implies $f(a+f(y))=f(b+f(y))$
And surjectivity implies then $f(x+(a-b))=f(x)$ $\forall x>b$

Let then $n\in\mathbb N$ great enough to have $f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b)>0$ and $2f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b)>b$
$P(1,f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b))$ $\implies$ $f(1+f(f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b)))$ $+f(2f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b))$ $=f(2f(1)-f(2)+2n(a-b))$ and so $f(1+f(f(1)-f(2)+n(a-b)))=0$, impossible

So $f(x)$ is injective and $Q(x,y)$ immediately gives $f(x)=x+c$ for some $c$.
Plugging this in original equation, we get $c=0$ and the unique surjective solution $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x>0$

g(g(x)+f(y))=2x-g(x)+2y-f(y) \ \ \ \ \   & (\forall x,y\in \Bbb{R}^+)
 \end{cases} \]\end{tcolorbox}
We can solve this problem using only second equation :
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $g(g(x)+f(y))=2x-g(x)+2y-f(y)$

Setting $x,y\to 0^+$ in $P(x,y)$ RHS, we get $\lim_{x\to 0^+}f(x)=0$ and $\lim_{x\to 0^+}g(x)=0$ and so $f(x)\le 2x$ and $g(x)\le 2x$ $\forall x>0$

As a consequence, $P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $2x-g(x)+2y-f(y)\le 2g(x)+2f(y)$ and so $\frac 23x\le f(x)\le 2x$ and $\frac 23x\le g(x)\le 2x$

If $a_nx\le f(x)\le b_nx$ and $a_nx\le g(x)\le b_nx$, then :
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $a_ng(x)+a_nf(y)\le 2x-g(x)+2y-f(y)\le b_ng(x)+b_nf(y)$

And so $\frac 2{b_n+1}x+\le g(x)\le \frac 2{a_n+1}x$ and $\frac 2{b_n+1}x+\le f(x)\le \frac 2{a_n+1}x$

And a simple sequence study implies $\boxed{f(x)=g(x)=x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution for both equations.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)^2+f(y))=xf(x)+y$
$f(x)$ is bijective.
Let then $u$ such that $f(u)=0$

$P(u,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=x$

$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)^2)=xf(x)+u$
$P(f(x),u)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=xf(x)+u$
So $f(f(x)^2)=f(x^2)$ and so $\forall x$ either $f(x)=x$, either $f(x)=-x$

Suppose now that $\exists u,v\ne 0$ such that $f(u)=u$ and $f(v)=-v$
$P(u,v)$ $\implies$ $f(u^2-v)=u^2+v$ and so :
either $f(u^2-v)=u^2-v$ and so $v=0$, impossible
either $f(u^2-v)=-(u^2-v)$ and so $u=0$, impossible
So no such $u,v$ and :

Either $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/179088}{Panoz93}]
	Another approach ...
In the initial equation we set $x=y=0$ and we get $f(f(0)^{2}+f(0))=0$ 
Also , we set $x=y=f(0)^{2}+f(0)$ and we immidiately conclude that $f(0)^2=0\Leftrightarrow f(0)=0$

So , now we set $x=0$ to get $f(f(y))=y$        $(1)$
Using $(1)$ we can substitute $x=f(x), y=0$ to get $f(x^2)=xf(x)$
Therefore $f$ is odd 

The given equation reduces to 
$f(x^{2}+y)=f(x^{2})+f(y)\Leftrightarrow f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b) $ for a non-negative 
Since odd , though , we conclude that $f$ satisfies cauchy for any real numbers $a,b$

Combining $f((x+1)^2)=(x+1)f(x+1)$ with cauchy we get f(x)=xf(1)
and thus , substitution to the initial gives us two possible solutions :

$f(x)=x$
$f(x)=-x$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/204311}{Onlygodcanjudgeme}]
	we know that function is bijective.
$  f(f(x^2) + f(y)) = f(x) \cdot x +y  $
$  (x,y) = (0,0) $ then  $ f(f(o)^2 + f(0)) =0 $
if $ f(k)= 0 $ , and $ f(k) = f(f(0)^2 + f(0)) $ we know that function is injective, so  $ k= f(0)^2 + f(0)  $
Put $ (x,y) = (k,k) $ then we have  $ f(0) = k $ 
 $ k= f(0)^2 + f(0)  $ and  $ f(0) =k $
$ f(0)= 0 $.So k is equal to 0 .
    Put $ (x,y) = (x,0) $ then we have 
$ f(f(x)^2)= f(x) \cdot x $  
    Put    $ (x,y) =(f(x) ,0) $ so we have $ f(x^2)= f(x) \cdot x $
in there $ f(f(x)^2) = f(x^2) $  then   $ f(x)^2 = x^2  $ 
$ f(x) = x $ or $ f(x) =-x $

No, $f(x)^2=x^2$ does not imply : "either $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$, either $f(x)=-x$ $\forall x$"

It implies : "$\forall x$, either $f(x)=x$, either $f(x)=-x$"
Which is quite different. For example $f(x)=|x|$ is such that $f(x)^2=x^2$

So you miss some work again before conclusion.

Let $t$ one period and we get $a(x+t)+\sin(x+t)-ax-\sin x\in\mathbb Z$ $\forall x$

Setting $g(x)=x-f(x)$, we get the equation $g(g(x))=g(x)-\frac x2$

$g(x)$ is injective and so, since continuous, monotonous. So $g(g(x))$ is increasing and so $g(x)=g(g(x))+\frac x2$ is increasing too.
So $g(x)$ is an increasing continuous injection from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$

Let $x\in\mathbb R^*$ and the sequence $a_n$ defined as :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=g(x)$
$a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}-\frac 12a_n$
And so $a_n=\alpha 2^{-\frac n2}\cos(n\frac{\pi}4+\varphi)$ for some $\alpha,\varphi$ depending on $x$ and $f(x)$.

So $A_n=\frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_n}$ $=\frac 1{\sqrt 2}\frac{\sin(\frac{(n+2)\pi}4+\varphi)}{\sin(\frac{(n+1)\pi}4+\varphi)}$

But $A_n=\frac{g(g^{n+1}(x))-g(g^n(x))}{g^{n+1}(x)-g^n(x)}\ge 0$ (since $g(x)$ is increasing) while $\frac{\sin(\frac{(n+2)\pi}4+\varphi)}{\sin(\frac{(n+1)\pi}4+\varphi)}$ does not have a constant sign.
Hence contradiction.

And so no such function.

1) Claim about general solution :
=====================
Let $A,B$ two supplementary subvectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $t\in B$
Let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ in $A,B$ (so that $x=a(x)+b(x)$)

Then $\boxed{f(x)=a(x)-2b(x)+t}$

2) Proof that any function in the form of 1) is indeed a solution
==========================================
Just a trivial check :
$f(x)-y=(a(x)-a(y))+(t-2b(x)-b(y))$
$f(f(x)-y)=(a(x)-a(y))-2(t-2b(x)-b(y))+t$ $=a(x)-a(y)+4b(x)+2b(y)-t$
$f(x+y)=(a(x)+a(y))+(t-2b(x)-2b(y))$
$2x-f(x+y)=2a(x)+2b(x)-(a(x)+a(y))-(t-2b(x)-2b(y))$ $=a(x)-a(y)+4b(x)+2b(y)-t$

And so $f(f(x)-y)=2x-f(x+y)$
Q.E.D.

3) Proof that any solution may be written in the form of 1), so that this indeed is a general solution
====================================================================
Let $f(x)$ such that $f(f(x)-y)=2x-f(x+y)$
Let $t=f(0)$
Let $g(x)=f(x)-t$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)-y)=2x-f(x+y)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(t)=-t$ and so $g(t)=-2t$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$  $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$ and so $f(x)+x$ is surjective

Subtracting $P(x,-x)$ from $P(x,y-x)$ gives $f(f(x)+x-y)=t+f(f(x)+x)-f(y)$ and so, since $f(x)+x$ is surjective :
New assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(x-y)=g(x)-g(y)$ 
Subtracting $Q(0,y)$ from $Q(x,-y)$, we get
New assertion $R(x,y)$ : $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$

$P(x,y)$ becomes then $g(g(x))=2x-g(x)$

Let $A=\{x$ such that $g(x)=x\}$ : $A$ is a $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace.
Let $B=\{x$ such that $g(x)=-2x\}$ : $B$ is a $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace. Notice that $t\in B$
$A\cap B=\{0\}$
Let $a(x)=\frac {2x+g(x)}3$ and $b(x)=\frac{x-g(x)}3$

$a(x)$ is linear and $g(a(x))=g(\frac {2x+g(x)}3)=\frac{2g(x)+g(g(x))}3$ $=\frac{2x+g(x)}3=a(x)$ and so $a(x)\in A$

$b(x)$ is linear and $g(b(x))=g(\frac{x-g(x)}3)=\frac{g(x)-g(g(x))}3$ $=-2\frac{x-g(x)}3=-2b(x)$ and so $b(x)\in B$

And $x=a(x)+b(x)$ so that $A,B$ are indeed supplementary vectorspaces.

And $g(x)=a(x)-2b(x)$
And so $f(x)=a(x)-2b(x)+t$

Q.E.D.

4) Trivial solutions
============
4.1) $A=\mathbb R$ and $B=\{0\}$
----------------------------------
So $a(x)=x$ and $b(x)=0$ and $t=0$ and solution $\boxed{f(x)=x}$

4.2) $A=\{0\}$ and $B=\mathbb R$
-----------------------------------
So $a(x)=0$ and $b(x)=x$ and $t$ is any real we want and so $\boxed{f(x)=t-2x}$

	\begin{tcolorbox}$f: \mathbb{N}^*\to\mathbb{N}^*$ satisfy all the following the conditions:
a) $f$ is strictly increasing
b) $f(f(n))=3n \quad \forall n\in\mathbb{N}^*$
Calculate $f(2004)$

Where $\mathbb{N}^*$ is set of positive integer.\end{tcolorbox}
$f(3n)=3f(n)$

If $f(1)>3$, then $3=f(f(1))\ge f(f(1)-3)+3$ and so $f(f(1)-3)\le 0$, impossible. So $f(1)\le 3$
If $f(1)=1$, then $3=f(f(1))=1$, impossible.
If $f(1)=3$, then $f(1)=3=f(f(1))$ and so, since injective, $f(1)=1$, impossible.
So $f(1)=2$ and $f(3^n)=2.3^n$
So $f(2)=3$ and $f(2.3^n)=3^{n+1}$

Since we have exacty $3^n-1$ values in $(2.3^n,3^{n+1})$ for exactly $3^n-1$ args (in $(3^n,2.3^n)$), we get :
$f(3^n+u)=2.3^n+u$ $\forall u\in[0,3^n]$

So, using base $3$ representation : $f(\overline{1\text{--anything--}}_3=\overline{2\text{--same thing--}}_3$

And then $f(2.3^n+u)=3(3^n+u)$ and $f(\overline{2\text{--anything--}}_3=\overline{1\text{--same thing--}0}_3$

And so $f(2004)=f(\overline{2202020}_3)=\overline{12020200}_3=\boxed{3825}$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $af(x,y)+f(x,y+1)+f(x+1,y)=x+y$

1) If $a\ne 0$, no solution.

$P(x,y+1)$ $\implies$ $af(x,y+1)+f(x,y)+f(x+1,y+1)=x+y+1$
$P(x+1,y)$ $\implies$ $af(x+1,y)+f(x+1,y+1)+f(x,y)=x+y+1$
So $f(x,y+1)=f(x+1,y)$ and so $f(x,y)=f(x,y+2)=f(x+1,y+1)$

$P(x,y+1)$ $\implies$ $af(x,y+1)+2f(x,y)=x+y+1$
$P(x,y+2)$ $\implies$ $af(x,y)+2f(x,y+1)=x+y+2$

So (eliminating $f(x,y+1)$) : $(a^2-4)f(x,y)=(a-2)(x+y)+2a-2$
If $a^2=4$ : no solution
If $a^2\ne 4$ : $f(x,y)=\frac{x+y}{a+2}+\frac{2a-2}{a^2-4}$ which is never a solution
Q.E.D.


2) If $a=0$, no solution
$P(x,y+1)$ $\implies$ $f(x,y)+f(x+1,y+1)=x+y+1$
$P(x+1,y+2)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1,y+1)+f(x,y)=x+y+3$
Impossible (subtracting leads to contradiction)
So no solution.

Let $a=\frac 32$ and $g(x)=h(\frac x4)$ so that system is :
$f(a^3x)=f(x)$
$f(x)-2f(ax)+f(a^2x)=g(x)$

Replacing $x$ with $ax$ and then $a^2x$ in the second equation, we get :
$f(x)-2f(ax)+f(a^2x)=g(x)$
$f(ax)-2f(a^2x)+f(x)=g(ax)$
$f(a^2x)-2f(x)+f(ax)=g(a^2x)$

If $g(x)+g(ax)+g(a^2x)\ne 0$ for some $x$, then no solution.
If $g(x)+g(ax)+g(a^2x)=0$ $\forall x$, then we immediately get $f(x)=\frac{g(x)+g(ax)}3+u(x)$ where $u(ax)=u(x)$ $\forall x$

And this last equation is quite trivial :

$u(0)=0$
$u(x)=v(\left\{\frac{\ln x}{\ln a}\right\})$ $\forall x>0$ where $v(x)$ is any function from $[0,1)\to\mathbb R$

A lot of the problems for which you  require help are quite similar. You should learn from the first help we gave you and be able to solve yourself the following problems. Are you simply trying ???? :?:

Replacing $x$ by $x+a$ and then $x+2a$ in second equation, we get :

$(1-\alpha)f(x)+\alpha f(x+a)-f(x+2a)=0$
$(1-\alpha)f(x+a)+\alpha f(x+2a)-f(x)=0$
$(1-\alpha)f(x+2a)+\alpha f(x)-f(x+a)=0$

Without any precision, I suppose that, as usual on this site, $\mathbb N$ is the set of positive integers ($0\notin\mathbb N$)

Let $P(x)$ be the assertion $f(x)=f(f(x-1))+f(f(x+1))$
Note that $f(x)=c$ constant is not a solution. So $|f(\mathbb N)|\ge 2$

Let $a_1=\min(f(\mathbb N))$ and $a_2=\min(f(\mathbb N)\setminus\{a_1\})$
Let $A_1=f^{-1}(\{a_1\})$

Let $u\in A_1$. If $u\ge 2$, $P(u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(u-1))<a_1$, impossible. So $u=1$ and $A_1=\{1\}$

Let $u\in A_2$. Since $u\ne 1$, $P(u)$ $\implies$ $a_2=f(f(u-1))+f(f(u+1))$ and so $f(f(u-1))<a_2$ and $f(f(u+1))<a_2$
$\implies$ $f(f(u-1))=f(f(u+1))=a_1$
$\implies$ $f(u-1)=f(u+1)=1$

If the problem is "find all functions $f(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f(x)=f(f(x-1))+f(f(x+1))$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R$", then you have infinitely many solutions.

Surely, $f(x)=\frac x2$ is one of them.

But for example, here is a nice continuous periodic solution : $f(x)=\min(\frac{\{x\}}2,\frac{|\sin \pi x|}6)$

And tons of other solutions (and I dont think we can easily find a general form for all of them).

$f(1)=1$ and so, since stricly increasing, $f(n)>1$ $\forall n>1$
Let $x,y>1$ and $p,q\ge 1$ (so that $f(x),f(y)>1$) :
$\frac{\ln x}{\ln y}>\frac pq$ $\implies$ $x^q>y^p$ $\implies$ $f(x^q)>f(y^p)$ $\implies$ $f(x)^q>f(y)^p$ $\implies$ $\frac{\ln f(x)}{\ln f(y)}>\frac pq$
And so $\frac{\ln f(x)}{\ln f(y)}\ge\frac{\ln x}{\ln y}$

$\frac{\ln x}{\ln y}<\frac pq$ $\implies$ $x^q<y^p$ $\implies$ $f(x^q)<f(y^p)$ $\implies$ $f(x)^q<f(y)^p$ $\implies$ $\frac{\ln f(x)}{\ln f(y)}<\frac pq$
And so $\frac{\ln f(x)}{\ln f(y)}\le\frac{\ln x}{\ln y}$

So $\frac{\ln f(x)}{\ln f(y)}=\frac{\ln x}{\ln y}$ $\forall x,y>1$

Taking then $y=2$ in this equality, we get $\boxed{f(x)=x^2}$ $\forall x\ne 1$, still true when $x=1$ and which indeed is a solution.

	All solutions.
Let $\phi(x):(\frac 29,\frac 23]\to R$ any function with condition $\phi(\frac 13)=\phi(\frac 23)=\frac 12,$
and for $x<\frac 13$, suth that $3^kx=1-x$ or $x=\frac{1}{1+3^k}, k\ge 1$ must be $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{1+2^k}$. Only one of them in interval $(\frac 29, \frac 14)$ (case $k=1$). 
But must be $\phi(\frac{3^{k-1}}{1+3^k})=\frac{2^{k-1}}{1+2^k}$, because $\frac{3^{k-1}}{1+3^k}\in(\frac 29, \frac 13).$

Define $f(x):[0,1]\to R$ as \[f(0)=0, f(x)=2^{1-k}\phi(3^{k-1}x) \ if \ x\in (\frac{2}{3^{k+1}},\frac{2}{3^k}], \ f(x)=1-f(x), if \ x>\frac 23.\]
This definition give all solutions.
If $\phi(x)$ monotic in $(\frac 29,\frac 13],  \phi(\frac 13)=\frac 12 =\phi(x), x\in [\frac 13,\frac 23]$, then $f(x)$ monotoniosly.
There are infinetely many monotoniosly solutions.

	We find unique value for suth rational $x=x_0=x_l$, were $x_i=1-\frac{x_{i-1}}{3^{k_i}}$.
For suth $x$ $f(x_i)=1-\frac{1}{2^{k_i}}$.
If suth $x$ density in interval $(\frac 29,\frac 13]$ then monotonically solution is unique.
I think, that you are right. suth rational numbers are density.
If $\frac{18}{1991}$ is suth x solution is unique visout monotoniosly condition.

\[\frac{18}{1991}=\frac{A}{3^{45}-1}, A=\frac{18*(3^{45}-1)}{1991}\in N.\]
$A=3^{k_1+...k_l}-3^{k_1+...k_{l-1}}+...-3^2$.
It give $f(\frac{18}{1991})=\frac{2^{k_1+...+k_l}-2^{k_1+...+k_{l-1}}+...-2^2}{2^{45}-1}$.

$f(n)+f(n+1)=f(n+2)f(n+3)-168$
$f(n+1)+f(n+2)=f(n+3)f(n+4)-168$
Subtracting the first from the second, we get $f(n+2)-f(n)=f(n+3)((f(n+4)-f(n+2))$ $\forall n$

And so, since $f(n)\ne 1$, $f(n+2)=f(n)$ $\forall n$ and $f(\mathbb N)$ is $a,b,a,b,...$ with $a+b=ab-168$
$\iff$ $(a-1)(b-1)=169$ and so $(a,b)\in\{(2,170),(14,14),(170,2)\}$

Because we got $|f(n+2)-f(n)|\ge 2|f(n+4)-f(n+2)|$ and so $|f(n+2)-f(n)|\ge 2^k|f(n+2k)-f(n+2k-2)|$

So $|f(n+2k)-f(n+2k-2)|\le 2^{-k}|f(n+2)-f(n)|$ $\forall k$ and so $|f(n+2k)-f(n+2k-2)|=0$ and so $f(n+2)-f(n)=0$

(in fact, consider that if none of $f(n+2k)-f(n+2k-2)$ is zero, $|f(n+2)-f(n)|$ is infinite, while if one is zero, then $|f(n+2)-f(n)|$ is zero).

You silently edited :( your problem and added the "continuous" constraint which changes strongly the problem.

Without any precision, I suppose that domain of functional equation is "$\forall x\ne 0$, $\forall y$". If so :

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $xf(y)-yf(x)=f(\frac yx)$, true $\forall x\ne 0$, $\forall y$

$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(1)=0$
$P(2,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$

Let $x\ne 0$ : $P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $-f(x)=f(\frac 1x)$

Let $x\ne 0$ :

$P(\frac 1x,2)$ $\implies$ $\frac 1xf(2)+2f(x)=f(2x)$

$P(\frac 12,x)$ $\implies$ $\frac 12f(x)+xf(2)=f(2x)$

Subtracting, we get $f(x)=\frac{2f(2)}3(x-\frac 1x)$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=a\frac{x^2-1}x\text{    }\forall x\ne 0\text{   and   }f(0)=0}$ which indeed is a solution.

So $f(f(f(f(x))))=(x^2-2)^2-2=x^4-4x^2+2$ $=x+(x+1)(x-2)(x^2+x-1)$ and so equation $f^{[4]}(x)=x$ has four roots $-1,2,a=\frac{-1-\sqrt 5}2$, $b=\frac{-1+\sqrt 5}2$

But $f^{[4]}(x)=x$ implies $f^{[4]}(f(x))=f^{[5]}(x)=f(f^{[4]}(x))=f(x)$ and so $f(\{-1,2,a,b\})\subseteq \{-1,2,a,b\}$

And since $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $x^2=y^2$, we get $f(\{-1,2,a,b\})=\{-1,2,a,b\}$

Note then that $f(f(-1))=-1$ and $f(f(2))=2$ and $f(f(a))=b$ and $f(f(b))=a$

If $f(a)=-1$, then $f(-1)=f(f(a))=b$ and $f(b)=f(f(-1))=-1$ and so $f(a)=f(b)$, impossible
If $f(a)=2$, then $f(2)=f(f(a))=b$ and $f(b)=f(f(2))=2$ and so $f(a)=f(b)$, impossible
If $f(a)=a$, then $f(f(a))=a$, impossible.
If $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)=f(f(a))=b$ and so $f(a)=f(b)$, impossible.

Are you joking ?

1) Proof that any function in the form I gave is indeed a solution.
===========================================
$\forall x\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)$ : 
$f(x)=h(x)$
$\frac 1x\in(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,+\infty)$ and so $f(\frac 1x)=-h(x)$ $=-f(x)$

$\forall x\in(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,+\infty)$ : 
$f(x)=-h(\frac 1x)$
$\frac 1x\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)$ and so $f(\frac 1x)=h(\frac 1x)$ $=-f(x)$

If $x=-1$ : $f(x)=0$ and $f(\frac 1x)=f(-1)=0=-f(x)$

If $x=1$ : $f(x)=0$ and $f(\frac 1x)=f(1)=0=-f(x)$
Q.E.D.

2) Proof that any solution may be written in the form I gave, and so that it is indeed a general solution 
=======================================================================
Setting $x=1$, we get $f(1)=-f(1)$ and so $f(1)=0$
Setting $x=-1$, we get $f(-1)=-f(-1)$ and so $f(-1)=0$

Let $h(x)=f(x)$

$\forall x\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)$ : $f(x)=h(x)$

$\forall x\in(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,+\infty)$ : $\frac 1x\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)$ and  $f(x)=-f(\frac 1x)$ $=-h(\frac 1x)$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f\left(\frac{(f(y))^{11}}{x^3y}\right).\left(f(\frac{x}{(f(y))^{2010}})\right)^3=1$

Let $g(x)=-6019\ln f(e^x)$ from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ so that $f(x)=e^{-\frac{g(\ln x)}{6019}}$ 

$P(e^{x-\frac{2010}{6019}g(y)},e^y)$ becomes new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(g(y)-3x-y)+3g(x)=0$

$Q(\frac{g(x)-x}4,x)$ $\implies$ $g(\frac{g(x)-x}4)=0$ $\forall x$

Let then $A=g^{-1}(\{0\})\ne\emptyset$
Let $u\in A$ : $Q(x,u)$ $\implies$ $g(-3x-u)+3g(x)=0$ and so, subtracting from $Q(x,y)$ $g(g(y)-3x-y)=g(-3x-u)$

And so $Q(x,y)$ is equivalent to the two assertions :
$R(x,u)$ : $g(-3x-u)+3g(x)=0$ true $\forall x\in\mathbb R$, $\forall u\in A$
$S(x,y,u)$ : $g(x+g(y)-y+u)=g(x)$ true $\forall x,y\in\mathbb R$, $\forall u\in A$

From here, we find the trivial solutions $g(x)=0$ and $g(x)=x$ (which give $f(x)=1$ and $f(x)=x^{-\frac 1{6019}}$ but infinitely many other solutions :
For example, choose any $g(x)$ such that :
$g(x)=0$ $\forall x \in\mathbb Q$
$g(x+q)=g(x)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$
$g(x)-x\in\mathbb Q$ $\forall x$
$g(-3x)=-3g(x)$ $\forall x$

But a lot of other possibilities exist and I dont think we can find a general form for all of them.

Once again, could you kindly confirm us that :
1) this is a real olympiad exercise you got in a real contest \/ exam (what contest ?)
2) you are quite sure that there is an olympiad level solution.

My own opinion is that this is a crazy invented problem and that your source is a quite bad source.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f\left(\frac{(f(y))^{11}}{x^3y}\right).\left\lfloor f(\frac{x}{(f(y))^{2010}})\right\rfloor^3=1$

$P(\sqrt[3]{\frac{f(1)^{11}}x},1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=\frac 1{n(x)}$ for some $n(x)\in\mathbb Z$

But then $\lfloor f(x)\rfloor\in\{-1,0,1\}$ $\forall x$ and so $\lfloor f(x)\rfloor\in\{-1,1\}$ $\forall x$ So $n(x)\in\{-1,1\}$

So $f(x)\in\{-1,1\}$ $\forall x$ and $P(x,y)$ becomes new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(\frac{f(y)}{x^3y})=f(x)$

Obviously, we get the two constant solutions $\boxed{f(x)=1}$ $\forall x$ and $\boxed{f(x)=-1}$ $\forall x$

Let us from now consider non constant solutions

Let then $x\ne 0$
Let $u\ne 0$ such that $f(u)=-f(x)$
$Q(u,x)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{f(x)}{u^3x})=f(u)$

$Q(u,\frac{f(x)}{u^3x})$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{f(u)x}{f(x)})=f(u)$ and so $f(-x)=f(u)=-f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is odd.

So $Q(x,y)$ may be written as new assertion $R(x,y)$ : $f(\frac{1}{x^3y})=f(x)f(y)$
Let $a=f(1)\in\{-1,1\}$

$R(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac 1x)=af(x)$ and so $R(x,y)$ becpmes $f(x^3y)=af(x)f(y)$

$R(x,1)$ $\implies$ then $f(x^3)=f(x)$ and $R(x,y)$ becomes $f(xy)=af(x)f(y)$

But then $R(x,\frac 1x)$ implies $a=1$ and $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ and so $f(x)=1$ $\forall x>0$ and so $f(x)=-1$ $\forall x<0$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=\text{sign}(x)}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

by setting x=1 and y=k we find that f($\ k^2$)=k then by injection k^2=1 . So we proved that k=1 or k=-1 , in the first we take f(x)=x the second f(x)=-x

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/16000}{tchebytchev}]
	Very similar to an old one 
-Let $a$ with $f(a)=1$ for $y=a$, $f(ax)=a^2f(\frac{x}{a})$ and by induction $f(a^nx)=a^{2n}f(x)$ and $f(\frac{x}{a^n})=\frac{f(x)}{a^{2n}}$ so from the condition b it is not possible that $a>1$ or $a<1$ so if $a$ exists then $a=1$
-Let $f(1)=a$ for  $x=y=1$, $f(a)=a$, $y=1,x=a$ gives $f(a^2)=f(a)=a$ so by induction again $f(a^n)=a$ and for $y=a,a^2,...,x=1$ we get $f(\frac{1}{a}),...,f(\frac{1}{a^n})$ so by condition b again we have $a=1$.
-for $x=f(\frac{1}{y})$ we have $f(f(\frac{1}{y})f(y))=y^2f(\frac{f(\frac{1}{y})}{y})$ and for $x=y$ we have $f(xf(x))=x^2f(1)=x^2$ so $f(f(\frac{1}{y})f(y))=1$ and by the first item $f(\frac{1}{y})f(y)=1$ 
-for $x=\frac{1}{f(y)}$ we have  $1=f(1)=y^2f(\frac{1}{yf(y)})$ so $f(yf(y))=y^2$ so $f(y^2)=f(f(yf(y)))=y^2f^2(y)\frac{1}{f(yf(y))}=f^2(y)$ and by induction ${{f(y^{2^n}})=f(y)^{2^n}}$
- Let $x^2f(x)=a$ then if we replace $x$ by $x^2$ and $y$ by $x$ then $f(a)=a$ and by the last remarks and the condition b we have $a=1$ and then the only function solution is $\frac{1}{t^2}$ which satisfy the conditions of the problem.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions$f: \mathbb(0;+\infty)\to\mathbb(0;+\infty)$ satisfying the conditions: a) $f(xf(y))=y^2f(\frac{x}{y})$ for all $x,y{\in}(0;+\infty)$, b) $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=0$.\end{tcolorbox}
Another solution :
Let $g(x)=\ln(f(e^x))$ from $\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$. 
Functional equation becomes assertion $P(x,y)$ : $g(x+g(y))=2y+g(x-y)$
Condition b) becomes $\lim_{x\to+\infty}g(x)=-\infty$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $g(x+g(0))=g(x)$ and so $g(x+ng(0))=g(x)$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$ and so (using condition b) $g(0)=0$ 

If $g(a)=g(b)=c$ :
$P(a+b,b)$ $\implies$ $g(a+b+c)=2b+c$
$P(a+b,a)$ $\implies$ $g(a+b+c)=2a+c$
And so $a=b$ and $g(x)$ is injective.

$P(0,-x)$ $\implies$ $g(g(-x))=-2x+g(x)$
$P(x-g(x),x)$ $\implies$ $g(-g(x))=-2x+g(x)$
So $g(g(-x))=g(-g(x))$ and, since injective, $g(-x)=-g(x)$ and $g(x)$ is odd.

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $g(g(x))+g(x)=2x$ and so $g(x)+x$ is surjective.

$P(x+y,y)$ $\implies$ $g(x+y+g(y))=2y+g(x)$
$P(y,y)$ $\implies$ $g(y+g(y))=2y$
Subtracting, we get $g(x+y+g(y))=g(x)+g(y+g(y))$ and so, since $x+g(x)$ is surjective, $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$

We know that non continuous solutions are unbounded everywhere and so condition b) implies continuity and $g(x)=ax$

Plugging in original equation, we get $a\in\{1,-2\}$ and condition b implies $a=-2$ and $g(x)=-2x$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=\frac 1{x^2}}$ $\forall x>0$, which indeed is a solution.

Let $g(x)=f(x)-(f(1)-1)x^2-1$ so that $g(1)=0$ and functional equation is :
Assertion $P(x,y)$ : $g(x+y)+g(x-y)=2g(x)+2g(y)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $g(0)=0$

$P((n+1)x,x)$ $\implies$  $g((n+2)x)=2g((n+1)x)-g(nx)+2g(x)$ and simple induction implies $g(nx)=n^2g(x)$

So $g(qx)=q^2g(x)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R,\forall q\in\mathbb Q$

So $g(x)=0$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$ and so, since continuous, $g(x)=0$ $\forall x$

There are infinitely many solutions, including neither injective, neither surjective one.

Choose any continuous function $h(x)$ from $[1,2]\to[1,+\infty)$ such that $h(2)=\frac{h(1)^2+1}2$

From there :
1) build the sequence of functions $h_n(x)$ from $[2^n,2^{n+1})\to[1,+\infty)$ as :
$h_0(x)=h(x)$
$h_{n+1}(x)=\frac{h_n(\frac x2)+1}2$

2) build the sequence of functions $k_n(x)$ from $(2^{-n},2^{-n+1}]\to[1,+\infty)$ as :
$k_0(x)=h(x)$
$k_{n+1}(x)=\sqrt{2k_n(2x)-1}$

Then define $f(x)$ as :
$f(0)=1$
$\forall x\in(2^{-n},2^{-n+1}]$ : $f(x)=k_n(x)$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$
$\forall x\in(1,2)$ : $f(x)=h(x)$
$\forall x\in[2^n,2^{n+1})$ : $f(x)=h_n(x)$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$

It's easy to check that this function fits all the requirements (the less obvious part is continuity at zero).

$f(x+1)=u+f(x+c)$

$\implies x+f(y)+f(z+c)=x+c+f(z+y+c)$

$\implies f(y)+f(z+c)=f(y+z+c)+c$

Define $g(x)=f(x)-c$. Therefore $g(y)+g(z+c)=g(y+z+c)$. Since both of $y$ and $z+c$ range through all the integers, $g$ satisfies cauchy equation for all integers. So $g(x)=ax$. Hence $f(x)=ax+c$. By checking, we get $a=1,-1$. So all the functions are $f(x)=x+c$ and $f(x)=c-x$.

Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(x^2+yf(z))=xf(x)+zf(y)$

$P(0,0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$

Since $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a non injective solution, it we be impossible to deduce from functional equation that all solutions must be injective.
So no.

\begin{tcolorbox}from $P(0,x,x)\implies f([f(x)x])=x.f(x)$
as $x,f(x)\in r$
can't we say $f(x)=x$\end{tcolorbox}

Since $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution, your conclusion is wrong.

The reason for which it is wrong is that $f(xf(x))=xf(x)$ implies that $f(u)=u$ not for all $u$ but only for those $u$ which may be written in the form $u=xf(x)$ for some $x$.

	Let $f:(0,+\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ function such that:
1) $f$ is strictly increasing.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Let $f:(0,+\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ function such that:
1) $f$ is strictly increasing.
2) $f(x)>-\dfrac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$.
3) $f(x)f(f(x)+\dfrac{1}{x})=1$ for all $x>0$.
Find $f(1)$.\end{tcolorbox}
From $f(x)f(f(x)+\frac 1x)$ and $f(f(x)+\frac 1x)f(f(f(x)+\frac 1x)+\frac 1{f(x)+\frac 1x})=1$, we get $f(x)=f(f(f(x)+\frac 1x)+\frac 1{f(x)+\frac 1x})$

So, since injective : $f(f(x)+\frac 1x)+\frac 1{f(x)+\frac 1x}=x$

So $\frac 1{f(x)}+\frac 1{f(x)+\frac 1x}=x$

So $xf(x)^2-f(x)-\frac 1x=0$ and so $f(x)=\frac{1-\sqrt 5}{2x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution (the other possibilities, where $f(x)=\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2x}$ for some $x$, may easily be rejected because $f(x)$ is strictly increasing).

Hence the answer : $\boxed{f(1)=\frac{1-\sqrt 5}2}$

It's a shame (according to me) to get such a question in an olympiad contest. It's a classical course question (interesting as a course question about piece per piece construction, but with very few interest in a contest).
Solution :

Let $u(x),v(x)$ any functions from $[0,1)\to\mathbb R$
Let $a,b$ any real numbers

One general form for the solutions is :

$\forall x>1$ : $f(x)=u\left(\left\{\frac{\ln |\ln x|}{\ln 2}\right\}\right)$
For $x=1$ : $f(1)=a$
$\forall x\in (0,1)$ :  $f(x)=v\left(\left\{\frac{\ln |\ln x|}{\ln 2}\right\}\right)$
For $x=0$ : $f(0)=b$
$\forall x<0$ : $f(x)=f(-x)$

	You might be interested in a somewhat similar problem:

Find all functions $f : R \to R$ which satisfy $f(x^3) + f(y^3) = (x + y)(f(x^2) + f(y^2) - f(xy))$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

[hide="A solution"]I claim the only solution if $f(x) = cx$ for some constant $c \in \mathbb{R}$.

Let us denote $P(x, y)$ to be the assertion. Notice that $P(x, -x) \implies f(x^3) = -f(-x^3)$ and letting $x^3 = z \implies f(z) = -f(-z)$, hence the function is an odd function. Now, $P(x, 0) \implies f(x^3) = xf(x^2)$. Using this result we obtain a new functional equation:

$f(x^3) + f(y^3) = xf(x^2) + yf(y^2) = (x+y)(f(x^2) + f(y^2) + f(xy)) \implies \boxed{yf(x^2) + xf(y^2) = (x+y)f(xy)...(1)}$

Let $T(x, y)$ denote $(1)$. Notice that $T(x, 1) \implies xf(1) = (x+1)f(x) - f(x^2) \implies f(1) = \dfrac{(x+1)f(x) - f(x^2)}{x}$.
Further, $T(-x, 1) \implies -f(1) = \dfrac{(1-x)f(-x) - f(x^2)}{x}$. Letting $f(1) = c$ for some constant, and subtracting $T(-x, 1) - T(x, 1) \implies \boxed{2cx = (x+1)f(x) + (-f(-x)(1-x))...(2)}$.

However, since $f(x) = -f(-x)$ (odd function), $(2)$ can be simplified as $2f(x) = 2cx \implies f(x) = cx$ for $c \in \mathbb{R}$.[\/hide]
\end{solution}

	 haha if $x=y=0$ i have $f(0)=0$ 
If $y=0$ i have $f(x^{3})=xf(x^{2})$

So that $xf(y^{2})+yf(x^{2})=xy(x+y)$ 
If $x=y$ i have $2xf(x^{2})=x^{2}.2x$ so i have $f(a)=a$ for $a>0$
But $f(x^{3})=xf(x^{2})=x^{3}$ so i have $f(x)=x$ for all $x$

	:P I have $xf(y^{2})+yf(x^{2})=(x+y)f(xy)$ , if $y=1$ and i set $f(1)=a$ so $xf(1)+f(x^{2})=(x+1)f(x)$
And if $y=-1$ i have $xf(1)-f(x^{2})=(x-1)f(-x)$
Because $f(x^{3})=xf(x^{2})$ so i have $f(x)=-f(-x)$ => $2xf(1)=(x+1+1-x)f(x)$ so i have $f(x)=f(1).x$ hihi check i have $f(1)=1$

This is from a past BrMO2: http://www.bmoc.maths.org\/home\/bmo2-2009.pdf

My solution is very similar to yours, but here is pco's solution:

\begin{tcolorbox}Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^3)+f(y^3)=(x+y)(f(x^2)+f(y^2)-f(xy))$
Let $a=f(1)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^3)=xf(x^2)$ and so $f(-x)=-f(x)$

$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x^3)+a=(x+1)(f(x^2)+a-f(x))$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^3)=xf(x^2)$
Subtracting, we get $0=f(x^2)+ax-(x+1)f(x)$
Setting $x\to -x$ in this last line, we get $0=f(x^2)-ax+(-x+1)f(x)$
Subtracting then these two last equalities, we get $\boxed{f(x)=ax}$ $\forall x$ and whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$, which indeed is a solution\end{tcolorbox}\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/192463}{arkanm}]
	Let the sum be $S$. Just note that $f(x)+f(1-x)=\frac{a^x}{a^x+a^{\frac{1}{2}}}+\frac{a^{1-x}}{a^{1-x}+a^{\frac{1}{2}}}=1$, so $f(\frac{a}{2012})+f(\frac{2012-a}{2012})=1$. Hence we can pair the summands whose argument has numerators of: $(1,2011), (2,2010), ..., (1005, 1007)$ to get $S=1005+f(\frac{1006}{2012})=1005+f(\frac{1}{2})$. Now since $f(x)+f(1-x)=1$, we have $f(\frac{1}{2})+f(1-\frac{1}{2})=2f(\frac{1}{2})=1$, or $f(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e. the function has a half-turn symmetry about $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$). Thus, $S=1005+\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{2011}{2}}$.

Subtracting, we get $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)-a$ and so $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ and $g(x)$ is additive.

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $g(a)=-a$
$P(a,0)$ $\implies$ $a=-a$ and so $a=0$
Q.E.D.

2.2) $f(x)$ may be written in the form of 1),
------------------------------------
Let $A=\{x$ such that $f(x)=x\}$. $A$ is a vectorspace.
Let $B=\{x$ such that $f(x)=0\}$. $B$ is a vectorspace.
$A\cap B=\{0\}$

Let $a(x)=f(x)$. $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=f(x)$ and so $f(x)\in A$ and $a(x)$ is a linear function from $\mathbb R\to A$
Let $b(x)=x-f(x)$. $f(b(x))=f(x)-f(f(x))=0$ and so $b(x)$ is a linear function from $\mathbb R\to B$

$a(x)+b(x)=x$  and so $A,B$ are two supplementary vectorspaces.
And $f(x)=a(x)$
Q.E.D.

3) some examples
============
3.1) trivial case $A=\{0\}$ and $B=\mathbb R$
--------------------------------------------
Then $a(x)=0$ and we got the trivial solution $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$

3.2) trivial case $A=\mathbb R$ and $B=\{0\}$ 
--------------------------------------------
Then $a(x)=x$ and we got the trivial solution $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

	\begin{tcolorbox}2.Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ that 
$f(x-f(y))=f(f(y))+xf(y)+f(x)-1$ for all $x,y real$ numbers.\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x-f(y))=f(f(y))+xf(y)+f(x)-1$
Let $a=f(0)$
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is not a solution. So let $t$ such that $f(t)\ne 0$

$P(\frac{x+1-f(f(t))}{f(t)},t)$ $\implies$ $f\left(\frac{x+1-f(f(t))}{f(t)}-f(t)\right)-f\left(\frac{x+1-f(f(t))}{f(t)}\right)=x$
So any real $x$ may be written as $f(u)-f(v)$ for some real $u,v$

$P(f(u),u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(u))=\frac{a+1-f(u)^2}2$
$P(f(v),v)$ $\implies$ $f(f(v))=\frac{a+1-f(v)^2}2$

And so $P(f(u),v)$ $\implies$ $f(f(u)-f(v))=a-\frac{(f(u)-f(v))^2}2$

And so, since any real $x$ may be written as $f(u)-f(v)$ for some $u,v$ : $f(x)=a-\frac{x^2}2$ $\forall x$

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $a=1$ and so the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=1-\frac{x^2}2}$ $\forall x$

	if y=0 we take f(0) = 0, and f(x) = 1. 
Firstly let we take f(0) =0 then we now that function is even.
let (x,y) = (1,1) then f(1) =0 or f(1) = 1, 
if f(1) =0 then we now that f(x) =0 .
if f(1) =1 then we now that all of the function is equal to 1

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $xf(x)+yf(y)=f(x+y)$

$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $2xf(x)=f(2x)$
So $P(2x,2y)$ $\implies$ $2xf(2x)+2yf(2y)=f(2x+2y)$ $\implies$ $4x^2f(x)+4y^2f(y)=2(x+y)f(x+y)$
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $xf(x)+yf(y)=f(x+y)$ $\implies$ $2x(x+y)f(x)+2y(x+y)f(y)=2(x+y)f(x+y)$

Subtracting, we get $x(x-y)f(x)+y(y-x)f(y)=0$ and so $xf(x)=yf(y)$ $\forall x\ne y$

Setting $y=1$, we get $f(x)=\frac{f(1)}x$ $\forall x\ne 1$, which unfortunately is never a solution.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $xf(x)+yf(y)=f(x^2+y^2)$

$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $2xf(x)=f(2x^2)$ and so $P(x,y)$ may be  written $f(x^2+y^2)=\frac{f(2x^2)+f(2y^2)}2$

And so $f(\frac{x+y}2)=\frac{f(x)+f(y)}2$ $\forall x,y>0$

Let positive real numbers $a\ne b$. Let $E_{a,b}=\{x>0$ such that $\exists m,n\in\mathbb Z,p\in\mathbb N$ such that $x=\frac{ma+nb}{2^p}\}$

Easy induction gives $f(x)=\alpha_{a,b}x+\beta_{a,b}$ $\forall x\in E_{a,b}$ for some real numbers $\alpha_{a,b},\beta_{a,b}$ depending on $a,b$

If $f(x)$ is not continuous at some point $u$, it's possible to find $v_k\to u$ such that the above line defined  from $v_k, u$ is negative for some $x>0$, which is impossible.

So $fx)$ is continuous and $f(x)=\alpha x+\beta$. 

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $\beta=0$ and $\alpha >0$.

Hence the answer : $\boxed{f(x)=\alpha x}$ $\forall x$, and whatever is $\alpha >0$

Setting $y=0$, we get $f(x)=f(0)+xg(x)$ and equation becomes assertion $P(x,y)$ : $xg(x)-yg(y)=(x-y)g(x+y)$

$P(\frac{x+1}2,\frac{x-1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x+1}2g(\frac{x+1}2)-\frac{x-1}2g(\frac{x-1}2)=g(x)$

$P(\frac{x-1}2,\frac{1-x}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x-1}2g(\frac{x-1}2)-\frac{1-x}2g(\frac{1-x}2)=(x-1)g(0)$

$P(\frac{1-x}2,\frac{x+1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{1-x}2g(\frac{1-x}2)-\frac{x+1}2g(\frac{x+1}2)=-xg(1)$

Adding these three lines, we get $g(x)=x(g(1)-g(0))+g(0)$ and so $g(x)=ax+b$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b$

Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(xf(y))+f(yf(z))+f(zf(x))=xy+yz+zx$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^2+yh(x))=xh(x)+f(xy)$

If $h(u)=0$ for some $u\ne 0$, then $P(u,\frac xu)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(u^2)$ $\forall x$ and the solution :

$\boxed{\text{S1: }f(x)=c\text{  }\forall x\text{ and }h(x)=0\text{  }\forall x\ne 0\text{ and }h(0)\text{ is any value}}$

So let us from now consider that $h(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$

Let $x\ne 0$. If $h(x)\ne x$, then $P(x,\frac{x^2}{x-h(x)})$ $\implies$ $h(x)=0$, impossible and so $h(x)=x$ $\forall x\ne 0$

Functional equation is then new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x^2+xy)=x^2+f(xy)$ $\forall x\ne 0$, $\forall y$, still true when $x=0$

$Q(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=x^2+f(0)$

And so $f(x)=x+a$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$ and so the solution ($h(0)=0$ is easy to get):

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x-y))=f(x)f(y)-f(x)+f(y)-xy$
Let $a=f(0)$

Note that $f(x)$ is not bounded. So $\exists u$ such that $f(x)\notin\{0,a\}$

Comparing $P(x,x)$ with $P(-x,-x)$, we get $f(x)^2=f(-x)^2$ and so $f(-x)=\pm f(x)$

$P(u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(u))=(a-1)f(u)+a$
$P(0,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(-u))=(a+1)f(u)-a$ and so :
Either $f(f(-u))=f(f(u))$ and so $(a+1)f(u)-a=(a-1)f(u)+a$ and so $f(u)=a$, impossible
Either $f(f(-u))=-f(f(u))$ and so $(a+1)f(u)-a=-(a-1)f(u)-a$ and so $af(u)=0$ and so $a=0$

$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)^2=x^2$ and so :
$\forall x$, either $f(x)=x$, either $f(x)=-x$

If $\exists x,y\notin\{-1,0\}$ such that $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=-y$, then :
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x-y))=-2xy-x-y$ and so :
either $f(f(x-y))=x-y$ and so $x-y=-2xy-x-y$ and so $y=-1$, impossible
either $f(f(x-y))=-x+y$ and so $-x+y=-2xy-x-y$ and so $x=-1$, impossible

And so :
Either $f(x)=x$ $\forall x\ne -1$ and then $P(2,1)$ implies contradiction
Either $f(x)=-x$ $\forall x\ne -1$ and then $P(-1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)=1$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=-x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution.

	I think i solve it.Let me explain.

Let x & y both be 0.then f(f(0))=f(0)f(0).
Again let x=y.then f(f(0))=f(x)f(x)-x^2.
f(0)f(0)=(f(x)+x)(f(x)-x).=>f(x)=x+f(0) or f(x)=-x+f(0).
Let f(0)=k (constant) then f(x)=x+k or f(x)=-x+k.
1st case........
Let f(x)=x+k then the condition becomes
x-y+2k=(x+k)(y+k)-(x+k)+(y+k)-xy => k^2+(x+y)k-2(x-y)=0 this is a quadratic eqn of k which can be solved easily.But solving the eqn we cant get k as a constant.So contradiction.
2nd case,
Now let f(x)=-x+k.doing as 1st case we get the quadratic eqn as follows
k^2-(x+y)k=0.
from this we get k=0 or k=(x+y).But k is a constant.So k=0.It concluds that f(x)=-x
Please tell if I am wrong.

$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=2f(x)+a$ and so $f(x+n)=2^nf(x)+(2^n-1)a$ $\forall x$ and $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$
So $f(n)=(2^n-1)a$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Then $P(x,n)$ $\implies$ new assertion $Q(x,n)$ ; $f(nx)=(2^n-1)f(x)$

$Q(x,2)$ $\implies$ $f(2x)=3f(x)$
$Q(2x,2)$ $\implies$ $f(4x)=9f(x)$
$Q(x,4)$ $\implies$ $f(4x)=15f(x)$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

Let $x=y=0,$ we get $f(0)=0.$ Now, for any $x,\,y,\,z \in \mathbb R,$ we have \[\begin{aligned} f(x+y+z)&=f(x)+f(y+z)+f\big(x(y+z)\big)\\ &=f(x)+f(y)+f(z)+f(yz)+f(xy)+f(xz)+f(x^2yz).\quad (1) \end{aligned}\] Changing the position of $x$ and $y$ in $(1),$ we get \[f(x^2yz)=f(y^2zx),\quad \forall x,\,y,\,z \in \mathbb R. \quad (2)\] Now, let $x,\,y \ne  0$ and take $z=\frac{1}{xy}$ in $(2),$ we have \[f(x)=f(y),\quad \forall x,\,y \in \mathbb R ^*.\quad (3)\] So $f(x)=c,\, \forall x \in \mathbb R^*.$ Plugging this result into the original equation, we get $c=0.$ So we have $f(x)=0,\, \forall x \in \mathbb R.$

	\begin{tcolorbox}$1.$ find all real valued function $f$ such that $f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})=f(x)f(y)$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})=f(x)f(y)$

If $f(0)=0$, $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(|x|)=0$ $\forall x$ and then $P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{S_1\text{  :  }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$, which indeed is a solution.

If $f(0)\ne 0$ :
$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=1$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(|x|)=f(x)$ and so $f(x)$ is even.

If $f(u)=0$ for some $u$, WLOG $u>0$, then :
$P(u,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\ge u$
$P(u2^{-\frac 12},u2^{-\frac 12})$ $\implies$ $f(u2^{-\frac 12})=0$ and so $f(u2^{-\frac n2})=0$ and so (using previous line) $f(x)=0$ $\forall x>0$
Hence a solution $\boxed{S_2\text{  :  }f(0)=1\text{  and  }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x\ne 0}$ which indeed is a solution

If $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x$, then $P(x2^{-\frac 12},x2^{-\frac 12})$ $\implies$ $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$
Let then $f(x)=e^{g(x^2)}$ and we get $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$

Hence a solution $\boxed{f(x)=e^{a(x^2)}\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is additive $a(x)$ (solution of Cauchy additive equation).

	Let $f(x)\not =0$.
1)$f(x+y_1+y_2)+f(x-y_1-y_2)=f(x)g(y_1+y_2)$,
2)$f(x+y_1-y_2)+f(x-y_1+y_2)=f(x)g(y_1-y_2)$,
3)$f(x+y_2+y_1)+f(x+y_2-y_1)=f(x+y_2)g(y_1)$,
4)$f(x-y_2+y_1)+f(x-y_2-y_1)=f(x-y_2)g(y_1)$.
From 3),4) 
$A=f(x+y_1+y_2)+f(x+y_2-y_1)+f(x-y_2+y_1)+f(x-y_2-y_1)=g(y_1)(f(x+y_2)+f(x-y_2))=g(y_1)g(y_2)f(x_1).$
From 1),2) 
$A=(g(y_1+y_2)+g(y_1-y_2))f(x)$.
Because $f(x)\not \equiv 0$
5)$g(y_1+y_2)+g(y_1-y_2)=g(y_1)g(y_2)$.
We know, that $g(0)=2,g(-y)=g(y)$.
Let $g(y)$ is continiosly and for small $y$ $1<g(y)<2$. We can find $a=a(y)$, suth that $g(y)=2\cos(ay)$.
Then we cheked, that $g(2y)=2\cos(a2y), g(3y)=g(y+2y)=2\cos(a3y),...$
For $y_1=qy_2, q\in Q, q\not =0$ must be $a(y_1)=a(y_2)$. By continiously $g(y)=2\cos(ay)$ for all y and $f(x)=A\sin(ax+b).
 If $g(y_1)>2$, then $g(y)=2\ch(ay)$. In this case $f(x)=A\sh(ax+b).$

Let $g(x)=f(e^{2x})$ from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ and functional equation becomes $g(\frac{x+y}2)=\frac{g(x)+g(y)}2$ $\forall x,y\in\mathbb R$

Solution of this functional equation is very classical  : $g(x)=h(x)+b$ where $h(x)$ is any solution of additive Cauchy equation.

There are two cases :

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)+f(xy-1)=f(x)f(y)+a$

1) Constant solutions
==============
If $x^2-2x+a=0$ has integer solutions (in fact if $a=1-n^2$), then we have the solutions :
$\boxed{S_1 : a=1-n^2\text{ gives }f(x)=1+n\text{  }\forall n}$

$\boxed{S_2 : a=1-n^2\text{ gives }f(x)=1-n\text{  }\forall n}$

2)Non constant solutions
=================
Let $b=f(1)$

2.1) $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=a$ and $b=a$ and $a\in\{-2,-1,1,2\}$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If $f(0)\ne 1$ : $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)-a=f(x)(f(0)-1)$ and so $f(x)$ is contant, impossible. So $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=a$

$P(-1,1)$ $\implies$  $f(-2)=ab+a-1$
$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$  $f(-2)=a^2+a-1$
Subtracting, we get $b=a$ (remember $a\ne 0$)

$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=a$
$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2)=a^2+a-1$
$P(2,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=a^3+a^2-a$
$P(3,1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=a^4+a^3-2a^2+1$
$P(4,1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=a^5+a^4-3a^3-a^2+3a$
$P(3,2)$ $\implies$ $(a-2)(a-1)(a+1)(a+2)=0$
Q.E.D.

2.2) Case where $a=b=-2$ 
----------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-2f(x+1)-f(x)-2$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_3 : a=-2\text{ gives }f(2n)=1\text{  and }f(2n+1)=-2\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.3) Case where $a=b=-1$ 
---------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)-1$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_4 : a=-1\text{ gives }f(3n)=1\text{  and }f(3n+1)=-1\text{  and }f(3n+2)=-1\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.4) Case where $a=b=1$ 
------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)-1$
Simple induction gives $f(n)=1$, which indeed is a solution, already noted in the paragraph "constant solutions"

2.5) Case where $a=b=2$ 
-------------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=2f(x+1)-f(x)+2$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_5 : a=2\text{ gives }f(n)=n^2+1\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

Uhhh ?, this is exactly the same exercise. You should have found alone from the previous one , according to me.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)+f(xy-1)=f(x)f(y)$

1) Constant solutions
==============
We immediately get two constant solutions :
$\boxed{S_1 : f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$

$\boxed{S_2 : f(x)=2\text{   }\forall x}$

2)Non constant solutions
=================
2.1) $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=0$ and $f(1)\in \{-1,0,2\}$
-------------------------------------------------
Let $b=f(1)$
If $f(0)\ne 1$ : $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)=f(x)(f(0)-1)$ and so $f(x)$ is contant, impossible. So $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=0$

$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=bf(x+1)-f(x)$ and so :
$f(-1)=0$
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=b$
$f(2)=b^2-1$
$f(3)=b^3-2b$
$f(4)=b^4-3b^2+1$

$P(2,2)$ $\implies$ $b(b+1)(b-2)=0$ and so $b\in\{-1,0,2\}$
Q.E.D.

2.2) Case where $f(1)=-1$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_3 : f(3n)=1\text{  and }f(3n+1)=-1\text{  and }f(3n+2)=0\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.3) Case where $f(1)=0$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=0$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x)$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_4 : f(2n)=(-1)^n\text{  and }f(2n+1)=0\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.4) Case where $f(1)=2$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=2f(x+1)-f(x)$

Here is a family of solutions :

Let $a\in\mathbb R$. Define $f(x)$ as :

$f(x)=x^2-2x+a\frac{(-1)^{x-1}}{((x-1)!)^2}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 2}$

Varying $a$, the required quantity may take any value we want.\end{tcolorbox}\end{tcolorbox}
pco? I think your solution for $f(x)$ is not correct.
I found, that $f(x)=x^2-2x+f_1(x)$, were
$x^3f_1(1+x)+xf_1(x)+f_1(1-x^2)=0$.
$f(0)=a$ can be any. But $f_1(y)\not \equiv 0$ for $y<0$ as in your solution.
There are infinetely many another solutions.

	Your solutution correct, but not full.
There are infinetely many suth $f$.
For example, I can define $f_1(x)\equiv e 0$ if $x<-N=1-k^2$ and $f_1(-N)=a_k$.
for $-N<x<-k$ $f_1(x)=\frac{-f_1(x-1)}{(x-1)^2}$, for $-k\le x<-1$ by $f_1(x)=\frac{-(x-1)f_1(x-1)-f_1(2x-x^2)}{(x-1)^3}$.
Then I can define in suth way other values of $f(x)$.

	Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy+f(x))=xf(y)+f(x)$

$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution and we'll consider from now that $\exists a$ such that $f(a)\ne 0$

1) $f(0)=0$ and $f(f(x))=f(x)$

Suppose $f(0)\ne 0$. Then $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=xf(0)+f(x)$ and so $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ $\implies$ $x_1=x_2$ and $f(x)$ is injective.
Then $P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(0))=f(0)$ and, since $f(x)$ is injective, $f(0)=0$, so contradiction.
So $f(0)=0$ and $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=f(x)$
Q.E.D.

2) $f(-1)=-1$

$P(f(a),-1)$ $\implies$ $0=f(a)(f(-1)+1)$ and so $f(-1)=-1$
Q.E.D.

3) $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

Let $g(x)=f(x)-x$

Suppose now $\exists b$ such that $f(b)\ne b$

$P(\frac x{f(b)-b},b)$ $\implies$ $f(b\frac x{f(b)-b}+f(\frac x{f(b)-b}))=\frac x{f(b)-b}f(b)+f(\frac x{f(b)-b})$

and so $f(b\frac x{f(b)-b}+f(\frac x{f(b)-b}))-(b\frac x{f(b)-b}+f(\frac x{f(b)-b}))=x$

and so $g(b\frac x{f(b)-b}+f(\frac x{f(b)-b}))=x$ and $g(\mathbb R)=\mathbb R$

but $P(x,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)-x)=f(x)-x$ and so $f(x)=x$ $\forall x\in g(\mathbb R)$ 
And it's immediate to see that this indeed is a solution
Q.E.D.

4) Synthesis of results 

We got two solutions :
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

1)put x=1 then we find that 
f(f(y))+yf(1)=2(y) then if f(1) is not equal to 0 ,we have f injective so 
2)put x=y we find that $f(xf(x))=f(x^2)$ then by injectivity f(x)=x and we will have contradiction because f is upper bounded
then we see that f(1)=0 and f(f(x))=2f(x) 
3)put x=y=0 we find that f(0)=0
if the max value of f is positive then take f(x)=k is max => f(f(x))=2f(x)>f(x)=k which is a contradiction 
hence f is not positive then max value is 0 (f(1)=f(0)=0)

	\begin{tcolorbox}find all $f:R\longrightarrow{R}$ such that

2)$f(xf(y))+yf(x)=xf(y)+f(xy)$\end{tcolorbox}
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(y))+yf(x)=xf(y)+f(xy)$
Let $t$ such that $f(t)\ne 0$

If $f(0)\ne 0$, $P(\frac{x}{f(0)},0)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x+f(0)$ which is not a solution, since not upper bounded. So $f(0)=0$

If $f(1)\ne 0$, $P(\frac x{f(1)},1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x$ which is not a solution, since not upper bounded. So $f(1)=0$
If $f(x)>0$ for some $x$, $P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=2f(x)$ and, thru repeated appplications, $f(x)$ is not upper bounded. So $f(x)\le 0$ $\forall x$

Let $y\ne 0$ : adding $P(y,\frac 1y)$ and $P(\frac 1y,y)$, we get $f(yf(\frac 1y))+f(\frac 1yf(y))=0$ and so $f(yf(\frac 1y))=f(\frac 1yf(y))=0$

Let then $x,y\ne 0$ : adding $P(x,\frac {f(y)}{xy})$ and $P(\frac {f(y)}{xy},x)$, we get $f(xf(\frac {f(y)}{xy}))+f(\frac {f(y)}{xy}f(x))=0$
And so $f(xf(\frac {f(y)}{xy}))=f(\frac {f(y)}{xy}f(x))=0$
Then, $P(x,\frac {f(y)}{xy})$ $\implies$ new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $\frac {f(x)f(y)}{xy}=xf(\frac {f(y)}{xy})$ $\forall x,y\ne 0$

If $f(x)\ne 0$, then $x\ne 0$ and :
$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=2f(x)$
$Q(f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac 1x)=\frac 2x$ 
So $f(\frac 1x)\ne 0$ and then $Q(f(\frac 1x),\frac 1x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=2x$ 

And so $\forall x$, either $f(x)=0$, either $f(x)=2x$

Note that this implies $f(x)=0$ $\forall x>0$ and $t<0$ and $f(t)=2t$

Let then $x<0$ : $P(x,t)$ $\implies$ $f(2xt)+tf(x)=2xt+f(xt)$ and since $xt>0$, this implies $f(x)=2x$ $\forall x<0$, which indeed is a solution.

Hence the two solutions  :

$\boxed{S_1\text{  :  }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$

$\boxed{S_2\text{  :  }f(x)=x-|x|\text{  }\forall x}$

Let $f(1)=f(-1)=a$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x)+f(y)=f(x+2xy)+f(y-2xy)$

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $a+f(x)=f(2x+1)+f(-x)$
$P(x,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)+a=f(-x)+f(2x-1)$
Subtracting, we get $f(2x+1)=f(2x-1)$ and so $f(x)=a$ $\forall$ odd $x$.

Then :
$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(-x)$
$P(x,2y+1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(x(4y+3))$
$P(2y+1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(-x(4y+1))=f(x(4y+1))$
And so $f(x)=f(x(2y+1))$ $\forall x,y$

Hence the answer $\boxed{f(0)=h(0)\text{ and }f(x)=h(2^{v_2(|x|)})\text{  }\forall x\ne 0}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $h(x)$ from $\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z$

You are welcome. Glad to have helped you.
I see that you have silently edited your problem, adding the "continuous" constraint. Then :

$f(x)=f\left(|x|^{4^n}\right)$ $\forall x\in(-1,1)$ and $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

Setting there $n\to+\infty$ and using continuity at $0$, we get $f(x)=f(0)$ $\forall x\in (-1,1)$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^2-f(y)^2)=xf(x)-y^2$
Let $a=f(0)$

If $f(u)=f(v)$, then comparaison of $P(0,u)$ and $P(0,v)$ implies $u=\pm v$

$P(1,0)$ $\implies$ $f(1-a^2)=f(1)$ and so $1-a^2=\pm 1$ and so $a\in\{-\sqrt 2,0,\sqrt 2\}$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-a^2)=0$
$P(0,-a^2)$ $\implies$  $a=-a^4$ and so $a\in\{-1,0\}$

So $a=0$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=xf(x)$ and so $f(-x)=-f(x)$ $\forall x$
$P(0,y)$ $\implies$ $f(-f(y)^2)=-y^2$ and so $\mathbb R_{\le 0}\subseteq f(\mathbb R)$ and so $f(x)$ is surjective (since odd).

So $P(x,y)$ may be written $f(x^2-f(y)^2)=f(x^2)-f(f(y)^2)$ and so $f(u-v)=f(u)-f(v)$ $\forall u,v\ge 0$
So, using odd property, $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ $\forall x,y)$

And $f(-f(y)^2)=-y^2$ implies $f(x)\le 0$ $\forall x\le 0$ and so $f(x)$ is a monotonous solution of Cauchy additive equation, so is $f(x)=cx$

Plugging back in original equation, we get $c=1$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$

I suppose $k\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))=y+f(x+k)$
$f(x)$ is injective

Let $c=f(f(k+1))-1$. Note that $c\ge 0$
Subtracting $P(x,f(k+1))$ from $P(1,f(x+k))$, we get $f(x+f(f(k+1)))=f(1+f(f(x+k)))$ and so, since injective, $f(f(x+k))=x+c$

$P(x,f(k+2))$ $\implies$ $f(x+k+c+2)=f(x+k)+f(k+2)$
$P(x+1,f(k+1))$ $\implies$ $f(x+k+c+2)=f(x+k+1)+f(k+1)$
Subtracting, we get $f(x+k+1)=f(x+k)+(f(k+2)-f(k+1))$ and so $f(x)=ax+b$ $\forall x>k$ with $a>0$ (since injective)

If $\exists u\ne 0\in A$, then $P(x+u,u)$ $\implies$ $f(x+u)=f(x)$ and so $|f(\mathbb Z)|$ is finite
$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=2f(x)$ and so either $f(\mathbb Z)=\{0\}$, either $|f(\mathbb Z)|=+\infty$


So :
1) if $|f(\mathbb Z)|$ is finite, we need $\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

2) if $|f(\mathbb Z)|=+\infty$, then $A=\{0\}$ and $P(2x-f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(2x-f(x))=0$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=2x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

	hi...
$m\rightarrow -f(n)$  gives $f(-n)=f(-f(n))+f(n)$ if we set $n=0$ well have $f(-f(0))=0$

$n\rightarrow -f(0)$   gives $f(m+f(0))=f(m)+f(-f(0))=f(m) $

if we set $m=-f(0)$ in the last equation well have $f(0)=f(-f(0))=0$ 

$\Rightarrow  f(0)=0$

set $m=0$  so $f(f(n)-n)=f(n)$ let $n \rightarrow m$ well have $f(f(m)-m)=f(m)$

set $n=f(n)-n$ in the main equation so $f(m-f(n)+n+f(f(n)-n))=f(m)+f(f(n)-n)$

$\Rightarrow f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$  $\mathbb{Z} : f(m)=mf(1) \Rightarrow ... f(m)=0$ and $f(m)=2m$ are the solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $\frac{f(y)}x+f\left(\frac{x^2-y}{f(x)}\right)=f(x)$

If $f(x)<x$ for some $x$, then $P(x,x^2-xf(x))$ $\implies$ $f(x^2-xf(x))=0$, impossible, and so $f(x)\ge x$ $\forall x$

As a consequence, $f(x)\ge\frac yx+\frac{x^2-y}{f(x)}$ $=\frac{x^2}{f(x)}+y\frac{f(x)-x}{xf(x)}$

If $f(x)>x$ for some $x$, then setting $y\to+\infty$ in above inequality implies impossibility. And so $f(x)\le x$ $\forall x$

Since $f(x_1)f(x_2)<0$ and continuous, $\exists$ non empty open intervals $I,J$ such that $f(x)>0$ $\forall x\in I$ and $f(x)<0$ $\forall x\in J$

Let then $\Delta>0$ and $i,j$ such that $i-\Delta,i,i+\Delta\in I$ and $j-\Delta,j,j+\Delta\in J$
The function $g(x)=15f(x-\Delta)+2f(x)+2014f(x+\Delta)$ is continuous and $g(i)>0$ and $g(j)<0$ and so $\exists t$ such that $g(t)=0$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(g(x)+y)=g(f(y)+x)$

So, since $g(x)$ is injective : $f(y+g(0)-g(x))=f(y)-x$
This implies $f(x)$ surjective, and so $g(x)$ surjective
Choosing then $x=t$ such that $g(0)-g(t)=1$, this last equation becomes $f(y+1)=f(y)-t$ and so $f(x)=a-tx$ and since surjective, $f(x)=x+a$ or $f(x)=a-x$ 

If $f(x)=x+a$, $P(0,x-a)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=x+g(0)$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x+a\text{ and }g(x)=x+b\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b\in\mathbb Z$

I consider that, as usual in this forum without precision, $0\notin\mathbb N$
Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(x^2+f(y)+z)=xf(x)+f(y+z)$

If $f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a>b$, then comparaison of $P(1,a,x-b)$ and $P(1,b,x-b)$ implies $f(x+(a-b))=f(x)$ $\forall x>b$
As a consequence $f(x)$ is bounded, in contradiction with functional equation whose RHS is not upper bounded.
So $f(x)$ is injective.

Comparaison of $P(1,x,f(1))$ and $P(1,1,f(x))$ implies then $f(x+f(1))=f(f(x)+1)$ and, since injective, $f(x)=x+f(1)-1$

Plugging this in functional equation, we get $f(1)=1$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy)=f(x)g(y)+f(y)$

If $f(0)=0$, then $P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$, impossible since $f(x)$ is strictly increasing. So $f(0)=\ne 0$

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=1-af(x)$ and functional equation becomes :
$g(x)$ strictly monotonous and $g(0)=0$ and new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(xy)=g(x)g(y)$

\[f(g(x))=x^2,g(f(x))=x^3,\;\forall x\in \mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
$f(g(x))=x^2$ $\implies$ $g(f(g(x)))=g(x^2)$
$g(f(x))=x^3$ $\implies$ $g(f(g(x)))=g(x)^3$
And so $g(x^2)=g(x)^3$

A a consequence $g(-x)=g(x)$

If $g(u)=g(v)$, we get $u^2=f(g(u))=f(g(v))=v^2$

From $g(f(x))=x^3$, we get that $g(x)$ is surjective.
Let $a$ such that $g(a)=-1$ and so $g(a^2)=g(a)^3=-1=g(a)$ and so $a^4=a^2$
Let $b$ such that $g(b)=0$ and so $g(b^2)=g(b)^3=0=g(b)$ and so $b^4=b^2$
Let $c$ such that $g(c)=1$ and so $g(c^2)=g(c)^3=1=g(c)$ and so $c^4=c^2$

So $a,b,c$ are three distinct real roots of equation $x^4=x^2$ and so $\{a,b,c\}=\{-1,0,1\}$
And since $g(-1)=g(1)$, we get a contradiction since $g(\{a,b,c\})=\{g(a),g(b),g(c)\}=\{-1,0,1\}$ while $|g(\{-1,0,1\})|\le 2$

So no such functions.

	yes Dear pco

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/89198}{chaotic_iak}]
	You should have said "nondecreasing" instead. "Increasing" is to be taken as "strictly increasing"; that is, if $x < y$, then $f(x) < f(y)$. (With nondecreasing, if $x < y$, then $f(x) \le f(y)$; equality might occur.)
\end{solution}

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all increasing functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that : 
\[ f(x+f(y))=f(f(x))+f(y)  , \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R} \] .\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))=f(f(x))+f(y)$
Let $A=f(\mathbb R)$
Let $B=\{x$ such that $f(x)=0\}$
Let $C=\{x$ such that $f(x)=x\}$. Note that $C\subseteq A$
Let $z=f(0)$

$P(-z,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(-z))=0$ and so $0\in A$
$P(x,f(-z))$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=f(x)$ $\forall x$ 
This last property implies $A=C$ and $z=0$

$P(x,y)$ becomes then $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+f(y)$ and from there it's easy to get that $A$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb R$

From there :

If $A$ is dense in $\mathbb R$, we easily get (using increasing property) $a=\mathbb R$ and $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution

If $A$ is not dense in $\mathbb R$, then :
either $A=\{0\}$ and we get then $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution
either $A=a\mathbb Z$ for some $a\in(0,+\infty)$ and so :
$f(na)=na$
$\forall x\in(na,(n+1)a)$ : either $f(x)=na$, either $f(x)=(n+1)a$ (we got a rising staircase function).
Using then $f(x+a)=f(x)+a$, it's easy to get the two families :

$\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=a\left\lfloor\frac{x+b}a\right\rfloor}$ $\forall x$ for any $a>b\ge 0$

$\boxed{\text{S4 : }f(x)=a\left\lceil\frac{x-b}a\right\rceil}$ $\forall x$ for any $a>b\ge 0$


\begin{tcolorbox}...${f(x)=a+\lfloor{\frac{x-b}{a}}\rfloor} , a\geq b>0 $ ,\end{tcolorbox}
If this was an example of solution, it is wrong.

$ f(x+f(y))=y+f(x+1) $ .\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))=y+f(x+1)$

$P(0,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(y))=y+f(1)$ and so $f(x)$ is bijective
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x+f(0))=f(x+1)$ and so, since injective, $f(0)=1$

So $P(x,y)$ may be written $f(x+f(y))=f(f(y))-f(1)+f(x+1)$ and since surjective, $f(x+y)=f(x+1)+f(y)-f(1)$

Writing $g(x)=f(x+1)-f(1)$, this becomes $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ and, since continuous, $g(x)=ax$ and $f(x)=ax+1$

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $a^2=1$ and so two solutions :

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=x+1}$ $\forall x$

$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=1-x}$ $\forall x$

	Thanks ! Very nice solution.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/173116}{Sardor}]
	Another Solution: Taking $ y = -f (x + 1) $, we see that there is a value a such that $ f (a) = 0 $. We
consider two cases.
Let first  $ a≠1 $. Taking $ y = x + 1 $, we get $ f (x + f (x + 1)) = x + 1 + f (x + 1) $. Let $
g(x) = x + f (x + 1) $, then $ f (g(x)) = 1 + g(x) $ for all x. Since $ f $ is continuous, so is $ g $.
Taking $ y = a $ in the initial relation, we get $ f (x) = a+ f (x +1) $, and so $ g(x -1)- g(x) =
a - 1 $ for all $ x $. Since $ a ≠ 1 $, $ g $ is unbounded and by continuity, takes all real values, so $ 
f (z) = 1 + z $ for all $ z $.
Let now $ a = 1 $, i.e, $ f (1) = 0 $. Then $ x = 0 $ yields $ f ( f (y)) = y  $ for all reals $ y $. Taking now $
y = f (1 - x) $ in the initial relation, we get $ f (x + f ( f (1 - x))) = f (1 - x) + f (x + 1) $,
or $ 0 = f (1 - x) + f (x + 1) $. Finally, taking $ y = 1 - x $ yields $ f (x + f (1 - x)) = 1 - x + f (x + 1) $, so $ f (x + f (1 - x)) = 1 - x - f (1 - x) $. Let $ h(x) = x + f (1 - x) $, then $
f (h(x)) = 1 - h(x) $ holds for all x. Replacing $ x $ with $ -x $ and taking $ y = 1 $ in the initial
relation, we get $ f (-x) = 1 + f (1 - x) $, so $ h(x + 1) - h(x) = 2 $. Again, $ h $ is continuous
and must take all real values, so $ f (z) = 1- z $ for all $ z $.
It is straightforward to verify that both solutions indeed satisfy the initial relation.

Setting $y=0$ in functional equation, we get $f(x)=xg(x)+f(0)$
Plugging this back in original equation, we get assertion $P(x,y)$ : $xg(x)-yg(y)=(x-y)g(x+y)$

$P(\frac{x+1}2,\frac{x-1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x+1}2g(\frac{x+1}2)-\frac{x-1}2g(\frac{x-1}2)=g(x)$

$P(\frac{x-1}2,\frac{3-x}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x-1}2g(\frac{x-1}2)-\frac{3-x}2g(\frac{3-x}2)=(x-2)g(1)$

$P(\frac{3-x}2,\frac{x+1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{3-x}2g(\frac{3-x}2)-\frac{x+1}2g(\frac{x+1}2)=(1-x)g(2)$

Adding these three lines, we get $g(x)=x(g(2)-g(1))+2g(1)-g(2)$ and so $g(x)=ax+b$, which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b\in\mathbb R$

Hence the answer : $\boxed{(f,g)=(ax^2+bx+c,ax+b)}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b,c\in\mathbb R$

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	First, clearly the functional equation cannot apply for $x=1$. Then, for $x=0$ we have $f(1)=af(0)$, and for $x=-1$ we have $f(0)=af(-1)$. Thus, for $a\neq 0$ we can arbitrarily take $f(1) = b$, and we get $f(0)=b\/a$ and $f(-1) = b\/a^2$, while for $a=0$ we get $f(1) = f(0)=0$ and we can arbitrarily take $f(-1) = b$. Except for these particular three values, proceed as follows.

Define $\varphi : \mathbb{R}\setminus \{-1,0,1\} \to \mathbb{R}\setminus \{-1,0,1\} $ given by $\varphi(x)=\dfrac {1+x} {1-x}$. Then $\varphi^2(x) = -\dfrac {1} {x}$, $\varphi^3(x) = -\dfrac {1-x} {1+x}$, $\varphi^4(x) = x$.

Your equation is $f(\varphi(x)) = af(x)$, so $f(\varphi^2(x)) = af(\varphi(x))$, $f(\varphi^3(x)) = af(\varphi^2(x))$, $f(x) = f(\varphi^4(x)) = af(\varphi^3(x)) = \cdots = a^4f(x)$, so $(a^4-1)f(x) = 0$. Thus for $a\neq \pm 1$ we have $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \{-1,0,1\}$.

For $a=\pm 1$, for any $x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus  \{-1,0,1\} \{-1,0,1\}$ we have the $4$-orbit $\{x,\varphi(x), \varphi^2(x), \varphi^3(x)\}$, and on it we can arbitrarily take $f(x) = b_x$, with the other three values uniquely determined.

Let $x\in\mathbb R$ and the sequence $a_n=f^{[n]}(x)$ and we get :
$a_0=x$
$a_1=f(x)$
$a_2=f(f(x))$
$a_{n+3}=3a_{n+2}-6a_{n+1}+4a_n+3$

So $a_n=n+c+r2^n\cos(n\frac{\pi}3+\varphi)$ for some real $c,r,\varphi$ depending on $x,f(x), f(f(x))$

If $r\ne 0$, then $\frac{a_{n+4}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+3}-a_n}$ $=\frac{1-3r2^{n+1}\cos((n+1)\frac{\pi}3+\varphi)}{1-3r2^{n}\cos(n\frac{\pi}3+\varphi)}$ may take, when $n\to +\infty$ positive and negative values, which is impossible since $f(x)$ is monotonous.

So $r=0$ and $a_n=n+c$. So $c=a_0=x$ and $a_1=\boxed{f(x)=x+1}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

If $f(a)=f(b)=c$ then $(a+1)c=af(b)+f(a)$ $=f(ab+f(a))=f(ba+f(b))$ $=bf(a)+f(b)=(b+1)c$

Not exactly.

Let $a=f(1)$.
Setting $x=y=z=1$ in functional equation, we get $a^3-a-3=0$
And so a unique positive value for $a$ easily got thru Cardano's formulas.

Setting $y=z=1$ in functional equation and using the above equation for $a$, we get $(f(x)-a)(2f(x)+a)=0$ and so :
$\boxed{f(x)=a}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

$f(f(x))=x$ implies $f(x)$ bijective and, so, since continuous, strictly monotonous.

If $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, then it's immediate to get the unique solution $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

If $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing, then $\exists a$ such that $f(a)=a$.
Let then $g(x)=f(x+a)-a$ and we get $g(x)$ continuous strictly decreasing and $g(g(x))=x$ and $g(0)=0$

The general solution for $g(x)$ is then :
Let $h(x)$ any continuous decreasing bijective function from $[0,+\infty)\to[0,-\infty)$
$g(x)$ is defined as :
$\forall x\ge 0$ : $g(x)=h(x)$
$\forall x<0$ : $g(x)=h^{-1}(x)$

Hence the general solution for original equation.

$f(f(x))=x$ implies $f(x)$ bijective.

$f(x)$ is bijective and decreasing and so $\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=+\infty$
$f(x)$ is bijective and decreasing and so $\lim_{x\to+\infty}f(x)=-\infty$
So $f(x)-x$ is continuous and positive when $x\to-\infty$ and negative when $x\to+\infty$ and so has a zero.
Hence the result.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(f(y)))=-f(f(x+1))-y$
$f(x)$ is bijective

$P(0,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(f(y)))=a-y$ for some $a=-f(f(1))$
Using surjectivity, let $u$ such that $f(f(u+1))=0$ : $P(u,f(y))$ $\implies$  $f(u+a-y)=-f(y)$

So $P(x,y)$ may be written $f(x+f(f(y)))=f(u+a-f(x+1))-y$ and so $P(x,0)$ becomes $f(x+f(f(0)))=f(u+a-f(x+1))$

Then, injectivity implies $f(x)=c-x$ for some $c$ and, plugging this back in original equation, we get $c=-1$

Hence the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=-x-1}$

$f \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \right) = f(x)f(y)$\end{tcolorbox}
$\boxed{\text{S1: }f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})=f(x)f(y)$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

Comparing $P(x,u)$ with $P(-x,u)$, we get $f(x)=f(-x)$ and so $f(x)$ is an even function and WLOG $u\ge 0$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)\in\{0,1\}$. But if $f(0)=0$, then $P(u,0)$ implies $f(u)=0$, impossible. So $f(0)=1$

If $f(a)=0$ for some $a>0$, then :
$P(x,a)$ $\implies$ $f(\sqrt{x^2+a^2})=0$ and so $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\ge a$
$P(\frac a{\sqrt 2},\frac a{\sqrt 2})$ $\implies$ $f(\frac a{\sqrt 2})=0$ and so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(0)=1\text{ and }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x\ne 0}$ which indeed is a solution.

So let us from now consider $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x$.

Let $x>0$ : $P(\frac x{\sqrt 2},\frac x{\sqrt 2})$ $\implies$ $f(x)>0$ and, since even, $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$

Let then $g(x)=\ln f(\sqrt{|x|})$ so that $f(x)=e^{g(x^2)}$ and functional equation becomes $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$

And so $\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=e^{a(x^2)}}$ where $a(x)$ is any additive function (solution of additive Cauchy equation)
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/179643}{_Mark_01}]
	Hi, Pco. I did as follows:
We have $\left[ f\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) \right]'_x = f'_x(x)f(y) $

$\rightarrow f\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = f'_x(x)f(y) $                 $(1)$

and $\left[ f\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) \right]'_y = f(x)f'_y(y) $

so $f\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = f(x)f'_y(y) $                              $(2)$

$(1)(2) \rightarrow \frac{f'(x)}{xf(x)}=\frac{f'(y)}{yf(y)}$

so $\frac{f'(x)}{xf(x)}=const$
then $f(x)=e^{cx^2}$

It is correct?

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)=f(x)f(a-y)+f(y)f(a-x)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(a)=\frac 12$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(a-x)=f(x)$ and so $P(x,y)$ implies new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x+y)=2f(x)f(y)$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $xf(y)+yf(x)=(x+y)f(x)f(y)$

If $f(u)=0$ for some $u\ne 0$, then $P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and so :
$\boxed{\text{S1 :}f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$

If $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$, then $P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=1$ $\forall x\ne 0$ and so :

What a strange quite uninteresting olympiad exercise !
This looks like a school course your teacher does not want to build himself :(

There are many many many different subcases (depending on situations where $a=0$, or $b=0$ with or without $p=0$ or $q=0$, plus the cases where $a+b=1$ with or without $p+q=1$, and so on ...)
Each case is quite elementary and classical but the sum of all cases makes it a boring long long long post.

I hope you are not trying to get a "general solution" for three specific exercises you got :(

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $g(f(x+y))=f(x)+(2x+y)g(y)$

	\begin{italicized}Solution\end{italicized}:
Let $P(m,n)$ be the assertion.
$f(m+f(f(n)))=-f(f(m+1))-n\forall m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$
$f(m+f(f(n')))=-f(f(m+1))-n'\forall m,n'\in\mathbb{Z}$
If $f(n)=f(n')\implies n=n'$
Hence the function is injective.
$P(0,n)\implies f(f(f(n)))=-f(f(1))-n$
$\implies f(f(f(n)))+n=-f(f(1))\cdots\cdots\star$
$P(m,f(n))\implies f(m+f(f(f(n))))=-f(f(m+1))-f(n)$
Using $\star$,we see that
$f(m-n-f(f(1)))=-f(f(m+1))-f(n)$
$P(f(f(1)),n)\implies f(-n)=-f(f(f(f(1))+1))-f(n)$
Denote $-f(f(f(f(1))+1))$ by $c$.
Hence $f(-n)+f(n)=c$
The original equation was
$f(m+f(f(n)))=-f(f(m+1))-n\forall m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$
It can be written as
$f(m+f(f(n)))=f(-f(m+1))-c-n\forall m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\cdots\cdots\star\star$
$P(m,-c)$(in $\star\star$)$\implies f(m+f(f(-c)))=f(-f(m+1))$
Due to injectivity,
$m+f(f(-c))=-f(m+1)$
$\implies f(m+1)=-m-f(f(-c))$
$\implies f(m)=-m+(1-f(f(-c)))$
Let $(1-f(f(-c)))$ be denoted by $k$.
Hence $f(m)=-m+k$.
Plugging this is the original equation,we get $k$ to be $-1$
hence $f(m)=-(m+1)\forall m\in\mathbb{Z}$.$\blacksquare$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $x^2(f(x)+f(y))=(x+y)f(yf(x))$

Let $A=\{x>0$ such that $f(x)=x\}$
If $u,v\in A$, then $P(u,v)$ $\implies$ $f(uv)=u^2$ and $P(v,u)$ $\implies$ $f(uv)=v^2$ and so $u=v$ and $|A|\in\{0,1\}$

$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=xf(x)$ and so $xf(x)\in A$ and so $|A|=1$ and $A=\{a\}$ for some $a>0$ and $xf(x)=a$ $\forall x$

Plugging back $f(x)=\frac ax$ in original equation, we get $a=1$ and so the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=\frac 1x}$ $\forall x$

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/187896}{Ashutoshmaths}]
	A nice problem.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion 
$P(x,x)\implies f(xf(x))=xf(x)$ hence $f(f(1))=f(1)$
Hence we observe that $f(1)$ has to be used.
$P(xf(x),f(1))\implies x^2f(x)^2=f(xf(x)f(1))$
$P(f(1),xf(x)) \implies f(1)^2=f(xf(x)f(1))$
Hence$f(x)=\frac{f(1)}x$
Plugging this in original equation, we get $f(1)=1$
Therefore, $f(x)=\frac {1}{x}\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^+$

Setting $n=1$, we get $f^2(1)<f(2)\le 2f(1)$ and so $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=2$

Using these values and the inequality $f^2(n)<nf(n+1)$, simple induction implies $f(n)\ge n$ $\forall n$
Using these values and the inequality $f^2(n)<2n^2f\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n+1}2\right\rfloor\right)$, induction implies $f(n)\le 2n^2$

Let $f(n)=n+a_n$ where $a_n$ is a non negative integer:
$f(n)^2<nf(n+1)$ implies $a_{n+1}\ge 2a_n$ and so $a_{n+m}\ge 2^ma_n$ and so $f(n+m)\ge 2^m(f(n)-n)+n+m$

So $2(n+m)^2\ge 2^m(f(n)-n)+n+m$ and, setting $m\to+\infty$ : $f(n)-n=0$ and $\boxed{f(n)=n}$ $\forall n$, which indeed is a solution.

$\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(x+y^2+z)=f(f(x))+yf(x)+f(z)$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$
$P(u,y,0)$, varying $y$ over $\mathbb R$ shows that $f(x)$ is surjective.

$P(x,0,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=f(f(x))+f(1)$
$P(1,0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(1+x)=f(f(1))+f(x)$
And so, subtracting, $f(f(x))=f(x)+f(f(1))-f(1)$ and, since surjective, $f(x)=x+a$ for some $a$, which, unfortunately, is never a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

So no other solution for this functional equation.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)+f(y))=x+y$
$f(x)$ is bijective

Let $u$ such that $f(u)=0$ : $P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=x+u$

Let $g(x)=f(x-2u)$ : $P(f(x-2u),f(y-2u))$ $\implies$ $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$
So $f(x)=g(x)+2g(u)$ and so $g(u)=0$ and so $f(0)=0$ and (using $f(f(x))=x+u$) $u=0$

So $f(x)$ is any additive involutive function 

A general form for such functions is :

Let $A,B$ two supplementary sub-vectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q-$vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ in $A,B$ (so that $x=a(x)+b(x)$)

Let $P(x,z)$ be the assertion $(1-z)f(x)=f\left(\frac{(1-z)f(xz)}{z}\right)$
Let $g(x)=\frac{f(x)}x$ from $\mathbb R^+\to\mathbb R^+$

Let $x,y>0$. $P(x+y,\frac y{x+y})$ $\implies$ new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(x+y)=g(y)g(xg(y))$

If $g(u)>1$ for some $u>0$, then $Q(\frac u{g(u)-1},u)$ $\implies$ $g(u)=1$, impossible. And so $g(x)\le 1$ $\forall x$
As a consequence $Q(x,y)$ implies $g(x+y)\le g(y)$ $\forall x,y$ and so $g(x)$ is decreasing (maybe not strictly)
If $g(u)=1$ for some $u$, $Q(u,u)$ $\implies$ $g(2u)=1$ and so $g(2^n u)=1$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ and so, since decreasing, $g(x)=1$ $\forall x$
Hence a first solution $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

Let us from now consider $g(x)<1$ $\forall x$ and so $g(x+y)<g(y)$ and so $g(x)$ is strictly decreasing and so injective.
$Q(\frac x{g(1)},1)$ $\implies$ $g(\frac x{g(1)}+1)=g(1)g(x)$
$Q(\frac 1{g(x)},x)$ $\implies$ $g(\frac 1{g(x)}+x)=g(x)g(1)$
And so $g(\frac x{g(1)}+1)=g(\frac 1{g(x)}+x)$ and, since injective, $\frac x{g(1)}+1=\frac 1{g(x)}+x$ and so $g(x)=\frac 1{ax+1}$ where $a=\frac {1-g(1)}{g(1)}>0$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=\frac x{ax+1}}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\ge 0$ (the case $a=0$ being the first solution we got previously).

	Clearly, $f(x)=x+c$ works.
Clearly, f is surjective.

We aim to show f is injective, then setting $x=0$:
$f(f(0)+y)=f(f(y))$
$f(0)+y=f(y)$
$f(y)=y+c$

Suppose not, and $f(z)=f(w)=c$, where $z-w$ is non-zero.

Note $f(f(z)+y)=2z+f(f(y)-z)=2w+f(f(y)-w)=f(f(w)+y)$
If $f(y)=z+w$ (since f surjective)
$2w+f(z)=2z+f(w)$,

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29428}{pco}]
	\begin{tcolorbox}$\mathbb{Q}$ is set of all rational numbers. Find all functions $f:\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}$ such that for all $x$, $y$, $z$ $\in\mathbb{Q}$  satisfy 
$f(x,y)+f(y,z)+f(z,x)=f(0,x+y+z)$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(x,y)+f(y,z)+f(z,x)=f(0,x+y+z)$
Let $g(x)=f(0,x)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $g(0)=f(0,0)=0$
$P(x,0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x,0)=0$
$P(x,y,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x,y)=g(x+y)-g(x)$

So $P(x,y,z)$ may be written as new assertion $Q(x,y,z)$ : $g(x+y+z)+g(x)+g(y)+g(z)=g(x+y)+g(y+z)+g(z+x)$

$Q((n+1)x,x,-x)$ $\implies$ $g((n+2)x)=2g((n+1)x)-g(nx)+g(x)+g(-x)$ and so :

$g(nx)=\frac{g(x)+g(-x)}2n^2+\frac{g(x)-g(-x)}2n$

Let then $h_1(x)=g(x)+g(-x)$. Previous equation implies $h_1(nx)=n^2h_1(x)$ and so $h_1(x)=h_1(1)x^2$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$
Let then $h_2(x)=g(x)-g(-x)$. Previois equation implies $h_2(nx)=nh_2(x)$ and so $h_2(x)=h_2(1)x$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$

And so $g(x)=ax^2+bx$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b\in\mathbb Q$

And so $\boxed{f(x,y)=ay^2+2axy+by}$ $\forall x,y$

I suppose that $0\notin\mathbb N$, as usual in this forum when no precision is given.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy+x+y)=f(x)+f(y)+f(xy)$
Let $a=f(1)$

$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2x+1)=2f(x)+a$ and so $f(4x+3)=2f(2x+1)+a=4f(x)+3a$
$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=3a$
$P(x,3)$ $\implies$ $f(3x)=3f(x)$

$f(6x+3)=f(3(2x+1))=3f(2x+1)=6f(x)+3a$
$f(6x+3)=f(2(3x+1)+1)=2f(3x+1)+a$
And so $f(3x+1)=3f(x)+a$

$f(6x+1)=f(3(2x)+1)=3f(2x)+a$
$f(6x+1)=f(2(3x)+1)=2f(3x)+a=6f(x)+a$
And so $f(2x)=2f(x)$

From $f(2x+1)=2f(x)+a$ and $f(2x)=2f(x)$, we easily get $\boxed{f(x)=ax}$ $\forall x\in \mathbb N$, which indeed is a solution.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(2x+f(x)+f(x)f(y))=yf(x)+x$
Considering that $f(x)$ can not be identically zero, we immediately get that $f(x)$ is bijective.

If $f(0)=-1$, then $P(f(1),0)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(1))=f(1)$ and, since injective, $2f(1)=1$, impossible. So $f(0)\ne -1$

Let $a=f(0)$ ($a\ne -1$)
Let $u$ such that $f(u)=0$
Let $v$ such that $f(v)=-1$ ($v\ne 0$)
Let $w$ such that $f(w)=1$ ($w\ne u$)

$P(w,u-w)$ $\implies$ $f(2w+1+f(u-w))=u$
$P(u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(2u)=u$
And so, since injective : $2w+1+f(u-w)=2u$ and so $f(u-w)+1=2(u-w)$

$P(x,u-w)$ $\implies$ $f(2(x+(u-w)f(x)))=x+(u-w)f(x)$

$P(x+(u-w)f(x),v)$ $\implies$ $x+(u-w)f(x)=u$ and so $f(x)=\frac{u-x}{u-w}$

Plugging $f(x)=bx+a$ in original equation, we get $\boxed{f(x)=x-2}$

My solution is completely different.
This problem is very hard(at least for me) :P
My solution:
Let $P(m,n)$ be the assertion.
First we will prove that there exist no constant functions.
If there exists such a function,
Let $f(n)=c\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}$
$\implies c=nc+m$ which is not possible as $m,n$ vary through integers.
Hence no constant functions exist.
$P(m,n')\implies f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n')\big)=n'\cdot f(m)+m$
Suppose $f(n)=f(n')$
$\implies nf(m)+m=n'f(m)+m$
As $f$ is non-constant, $\exists m$ such that $f(m)\neq 0$
$\implies f$ is injective.
$P(m,0)\implies f(2m+f(m)+f(0))=m$
Hence the function is surjective, hence bijective.
Hence, $\exists c$ such that $f(c)=-1$
$P(m,c)\implies f(2m)=cf(m)+m$
Taking $m=0$
$f(0)=cf(0)\implies f(0)(c-1)=0$
If $f(0)=0$
===============================================================
If $c-1=0\implies c=1\implies f(1)=-1$
$P(m,1)\implies f(2m)=f(m)+m$
Taking $m=1$ we get $f(2)=f(1)+1=-1+1=0$,hence $f(2)=0$
We had already proved
$P(1,n)\implies f(1-f(n))=1-n\cdots(\bigstar)$
$P(2,n)\implies f(4)=2$
In $(\bigstar)$, we substitute $n=4\implies f(1-f(4))=-3\implies f(-1)=-3$
Now it is easy to see that $f(n)=n-2\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$
We can easily prove this claim using induction.
==============================================================
If $f(0)=0$
By surjectivity,
$\exists k$ such that $f(k)=-1$
$P\left(m,\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\implies f\left(2m+f(m)+f(m)f\left(\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\right)=0$
As $n$ is an integer, we are taking $n=\frac{-m}{f(m)}$, hence $f(m)$ must divide $m$ so I took $f(m)=-1$ as by surjectivity, there exists such $m$
$m=k\implies f(2k-1-f(k))=0\implies f(k)=2k-1\implies 2k-1=-1$
$\implies k=0$
Not possible
Only solutions are $f(x)=x-2\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}$

Could you show us this "easy" induction ?

You can only write this for those $m$ such that $f(m)|m$
And not say that $f(m)|m$ since you wrote that !!!!

	Ok pco, I will complete it:
$ P\left(m,\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\implies f\left(2m+f(m)+f(m)f\left(\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\right)=0 $
Only for those $m$ for which $f(m)$ divides $m$.
Due to surjectivity, $\exists k$ such that $f(k)=-1$
And $\frac{k}{f(k)}\in\mathbb{Z}$ as $-1$ divides everything.
I got $k=0$This means $f(k)=-1\implies f(0)=-1$ but $f(0)=0$
But bijectivity implies one to one correspondence,hence there cannot exist an element in the codomain for which
there are two images in the domain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
And I did not mean induction,(I typed that by a mistake)
I meant an algorithm:
We have $f(1)=-1$,
and $ f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n)\big)=n\cdot f(m)+m,\quad\forall m,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}$
I had found some values which suggested that $f(n)$ is possibly $n-2$.
I had thought that by finding out some values, one can guess an algorithm.
Wait, I will find it and post it..
Everything else is okay ,no?

	Please check the full solution:(Induction included here)
\begin{tcolorbox}[quote="CanVQ"]Find all functions $f:\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$ thỏa mãn \[f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n)\big)=n\cdot f(m)+m,\quad\forall m,\,n \in \mathbb Z.\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(m,n)$ be the assertion.
First we will prove that there exist no constant functions.
If there exists such a function,
Let $f(n)=c\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}$
$\implies c=nc+m$ which is not possible as $m,n$ vary through integers.
Hence no constant functions exist.
$P(m,n')\implies f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n')\big)=n'\cdot f(m)+m$
Suppose $f(n)=f(n')$
$\implies nf(m)+m=n'f(m)+m$
As $f$ is non-constant, $\exists m$ such that $f(m)\neq 0$
$\implies f$ is injective.
$P(m,0)\implies f(2m+f(m)+f(0))=m$
Hence the function is surjective, hence bijective.
Hence, $\exists c$ such that $f(c)=-1$
$P(m,c)\implies f(2m)=cf(m)+m$
Taking $m=0$
$f(0)=cf(0)\implies f(0)(c-1)=0$
If $f(0)=0$
===============================================================
If $c-1=0\implies c=1\implies f(1)=-1$
$P(m,1)\implies f(2m)=f(m)+m$
Taking $m=1$ we get $f(2)=f(1)+1=-1+1=0$,hence $f(2)=0$
We had already proved
$P(1,n)\implies f(1-f(n))=1-n\cdots(\bigstar)$
$P(2,n)\implies f(4)=2$
In $(\bigstar)$, we substitute $n=4\implies f(1-f(4))=-3\implies f(-1)=-3$
Now it is easy to see that $f(n)=n-2\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$
Here is the induction:
$f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n)\big)=n\cdot f(m)+m,\quad\forall m,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}$
We have $f(1)=-1$
Aim:To prove $f(n)=n-2$.
$P(m,1)\implies f(2m)=f(m)+m$
Hence $f(2(1+f(n)))=f(1+f(n))+(1+f(n))$
Say $f(n)=n-2$ for some $n$.
$P(1,n)\implies f(2-1-n+2)=-n+1\implies f(3-n)=-n+1$
$\implies f(3-(n+3))=-n-3+1\implies f(-n)=-n-2$
For the positive integers part, we do this:
$P(3,n)\implies f(6+1+1\cdot (n-2))=n+3$
$\implies f(n+5)=n+3$
This covers the positive integers part.$f\big(2m+f(m)+f(m)\cdot f(n)\big)=n\cdot f(m)+m,\quad\forall m,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}$
We have $f(1)=-1$
Aim:To prove $f(n)=n-2$.
$P(m,1)\implies f(2m)=f(m)+m$
Hence $f(2(1+f(n)))=f(1+f(n))+(1+f(n))$
Say $f(n)=n-2$ for some particular $n$
$P(1,n)\implies f(2-1-n+2)=-n+1\implies f(3-n)=-n+1$
$\implies f(3-(n+3))=-n-3+1\implies f(-n)=-n-2$
For the positive integers part, we do this:
$P(3,n)\implies f(6+1+1\cdot (n-2))=n+3$
$\implies f(n+5)=n+3$
This means if we know the value of $f(n)$,we can find $f(-n)$
As we have $\implies f(n+5)=n+3$
for any $n$ which has $f(n)=n-2$,
To complete the induction, we have to find $5$ continuous values...
Which we have already found out. $f(-1),f(0),f(1),f(2),f(3)$
$P(0,0)\implies f(f(0)^2+f(0))=0$ and we have already proved $f(2)=0$
Hence by injectivity, $f(0)^2+f(0)=2$ either $f(0)=-2$ or $f(0)=1$
$f(0)= 1$ can be easily disapproved giving $f(2)=0$,
With $f(0)$, it is easy to find $f(3)$
And this is how we know the 5 continuous values.
Hence it is proved for positive integers that $f(n)=n-2$,
And we have already proved that if we know $f(n)$, we can easily find $f(-n)$
Thus, we have proved $f(n)=n-2$ for all integers.
Induction complete
==============================================================
If $f(0)=0$
By surjectivity,
$\exists k$ such that $f(k)=-1$
$P\left(m,\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\implies f\left(2m+f(m)+f(m)f\left(\frac{-m}{f(m)}\right)\right)=0$
Only for those $m$ for which $f(m)$ divides $m$.
Due to surjectivity, $\exists k$ such that$ f(k)=-1$
And $\frac{k}{f(k)}\in\mathbb{Z}$ as $-1$ divides everything.
$m=k\implies f(2k-1-f(k))=0\implies f(k)=2k-1\implies 2k-1=-1$
$\implies k=0$
This means $f(k)=-1\implies f(0)=-1$ but $f(0)=0$
But bijectivity implies one to one correspondence,hence there cannot exist an element in the codomain for which
there are two images in the domain.
Only solutions are $f(x)=x-2\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}\Box$[\/hide]

I considered, as usual in this forum, that without any precision $0\notin\mathbb N$

In order $f(f(x))$ be defined in b), we need $f(x)$ be from $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$
If $f(f(x))>1$ for some $x$, then $b)$ implies $f(x)$ not upperbounded, impossible since periodic (and so $|f(\mathbb N)|\le 22$). 
So $f(f(x))=1$ $\forall x$ and $f(x^2y)=f(y)$ $\forall x,y$

So (using a) $f(22)=f(22^2x)$ and (using b) $f(22^2x)=f(x)$ and so $f(x)$ is constant and so, since $f(f(x))=1$ :

$\boxed{f(x)=1\text{   }\forall x}$

We'll first consider the case where $f(x)$ is from $\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Q$ allowing the set of solutions to be a $\mathbb Q-$vectorspace.
We'll show then that this vectorspace has a dimension $\le 4$ and we'll exhibit four independant solutions, and so a basis.
From there, general solution will be immediate and coming back to the $\mathbb Z$-casis very easy.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y-xy)=f(x)+f(y)-f(xy)$

1) The space of solutions is a $\mathbb Q-$vectorspace.
===================================
Trivial

2) knowledge of $f(-1),f(0),f(1),f(2),f(3)$ is enough to define $f(x)$ and so dimension is $\le 5$
==============================================================
Subtracting $P(2x-2,-1)$ from $P(2x,2)$, we get $f(4x)=f(4x-5)+f(2x)-f(2x-2)+f(2)-f(-1)$
Subtracting $P(2x-1,-1)$ from $P(2x+1,2)$, we get $f(4x+2)=f(4x-3)+f(2x+1)-f(2x-1)+f(2)-f(-1)$

$P(2x+1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(4x+1)=f(2x+1)+f(-1)-f(-2x-1)$
$P(-2x-1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-4x-3)=f(-2x-1)+f(-1)-f(2x+1)$
$P(-x,-3)$ $\implies$ $f(-4x-3)=f(-x)+f(-3)-f(3x)$
$P(x,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(2x-1)=f(x)+f(-1)-f(-x)$
$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-3)=2f(-1)-f(1)$
Adding the two first lines and subtracting the three last, we get : $f(4x+1)=f(3x)+f(2x-1)-f(x)+f(1)-f(-1)$

$P(2x+2,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(4x+3)=f(2x+2)+f(-1)-f(-2x-2)$
$P(x+1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(2x+1)=f(x+1)+f(-1)-f(-x-1)$
$P(-x-1,2)$ $\implies$ $f(x+3)=f(-x-1)+f(2)-f(-2x-2)$
Subtracting the two last lines from the first, we get : $f(4x+3)=f(2x+2)+f(2x+1)+f(x+3)-f(x+1)-f(2)$

And so we got four equations :
$Q_0(x)$ : $f(4x)=f(4x-5)+f(2x)-f(2x-2)+f(2)-f(-1)$
$Q_1(x)$ : $f(4x+1)=f(3x)+f(2x-1)-f(x)+f(1)-f(-1)$
$Q_2(x)$ : $f(4x+2)=f(4x-3)+f(2x+1)-f(2x-1)+f(2)-f(-1)$
$Q_3(x)$ : $f(4x+3)=f(2x+2)+f(2x+1)+f(x+3)-f(x+1)-f(2)$
Which allow, varying $x$ from $1\to+\infty$ to determine $f(x)$ $\forall x\ge 4$ wth knowledge of $f(-1),f(0),f(1),f(2),f(3)$

Then $P(x,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-x)=-f(2x-1)+f(x)+f(-1)$ and so we get also knowledge of $f(x)$ $\forall x\le -2$
Q.E.D.

3) Dimension is $\le 4$
==============
(a) $P(-2,3)$ $\implies$ $f(7)=f(-2)+f(3)-f(-6)$
(b) $P(2,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=f(2)+f(-1)-f(-2)$
(c) $P(6,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(11)=f(6)+f(-1)-f(-6)$
(d) $Q_3(2)$ $\implies$ $f(11)=f(6)+2f(5)-f(3)-f(2)$
(e) $Q_3(1)$ $\implies$ $f(7)=2f(4)+f(3)-2f(2)$
(f) $Q_1(1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=f(3)+f(1)-f(-1)$
(g) $Q_0(1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=2f(2)-f(0)$

a+b-c+d-e+2f-2g gives then  $f(-1)=-f(2)+f(1)+f(0)$ and so knowledge of $f(0),f(1),f(2),f(3)$ is enough to fully determine $f(x)$
Q.E.D.

4) Dimension is $4$
=============
We can (rather) easily exhibit four solutions :

$f_1(x)=x$ $\forall x$ is a solution 

$f_2(x)=\left\lceil\frac x2\right\rceil$ $\forall x$ is a solution

$f_3(x)=\left\lceil\frac x3\right\rceil$ $\forall x$ is a solution

$f_4(x)=1$ $\forall x$ is a solution

And it's immediate to check that these four solutions are independant
Q.E.D

5) General solution
=============
Considering the previous basis, we got a general solution of the $\mathbb Q$-problem : 
$f(x)=ax$ $+b\left\lceil\frac x2\right\rceil$ $+c\left\lceil\frac x3\right\rceil$ $+d$ where $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Q$

And it's easy (but not automatic, it does not work with all basis) to get that $f(x)\in\mathbb Z$ $\forall x$ $\iff$ $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z$

Hence the result :

$\boxed{f(x)=ax+b\left\lceil\frac x2\right\rceil+c\left\lceil\frac x3\right\rceil+d}$ $\forall x$, whatever are $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z$

	Find all $f:R\rightarrow R$ such that
$f(xf(x+y)) = f(yf(x)) + x^2$ For all real $x,y.$
	\flushright \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h583851}{(Link to AoPS)}
\end{problem}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29428}{pco}]
	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all $f:R\rightarrow R$ such that
$f(xf(x+y)) = f(yf(x)) + x^2$ For all real $x,y.$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(x+y))=f(yf(x))+x^2$

If $f(0)\ne 0$, then $P(0,\frac{x}{f(0)})$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(0)$ $\forall x$, which is not a solution. So $f(0)=0$

1) $f(x)$ is injective
============
If $f(x)=0$ for some $x$, then $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $x=0$
If $f(u)=f(v)=0$ for some $u,v$, then previous line implies $u=v=0$
If $f(u)=f(v)\ne 0$, then :
$P(u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(uf(u))=u^2$
$P(u,v-u)$ $\implies$ $f(uf(v))=f((v-u)f(u))+u^2$ and so $f((v-u)f(u))=0$ and so $u=v$
Q.E.D.

2) $f(2x)=2f(x)$
==========
$P(x\sqrt 2,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x\sqrt 2f(x\sqrt 2))=2x^2$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=x^2$
$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(2x))=f(xf(x))+x^2=2x^2$ $=f(x\sqrt 2f(x\sqrt 2))$ and so, since injective, $xf(2x)=x\sqrt 2f(x\sqrt 2)$
And so $f(x\sqrt 2)=\sqrt 2f(x)$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$
Q.E.D.

3) $f(x)=f(1)x$ $\forall x$ 
================
a: $P(x,1-x)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(1))=f((1-x)f(x))+x^2$
b: $P(2x,1-x)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x+1))=f((1-x)f(x))+2x^2$
c: $P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x+1))=f(f(x))+x^2$
a-b+c : $f(xf(1))=f(f(x))$

And so, since injective, $f(x)=xf(1)$ $\forall x$
Q.E.D.

4) Solutions
========
Plugging $f(x)=xf(1)$ back in original equation, we get $f(1)^2=1$ and so the two solutions :
$\boxed{\text{S1: }f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$

$\boxed{\text{S2: }f(x)=-x\text{  }\forall x}$

$f(x)f(yf(x)-1)=x^2f(y)-f(x)$ for all $x,y \in R$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all $f:R \rightarrow R$ such that

$f(x)f(yf(x)-1)=x^2f(y)-f(x)$ for all $x,y \in R$.\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x)f(yf(x)-1)=x^2f(y)-f(x)$

$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(1)f(f(1)-1)=0$ and so $\exists u$ such that $f(u)=0$

If $u\ne 0$, then $P(u,x)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{S1: f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution

So let us from now consider $f(x)=0$ $\iff$ $x=0$
$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(1)=1$
$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)=-1$
$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x-1)=f(x)-1$ and so $P(x,y)$ may be written as new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x)f(yf(x))=x^2f(y)$
$P(-1,-x)$ $\implies$ $f(-x)=-f(x)$ and the function is odd.

Let $x\ne 0$ : $Q(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=x^2$ still true if $x=0$ and so, since odd, $f(x)$ is surjective 
$Q(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)f(f(x))=x^2$ and so, since odd, $f(x)$ is injective, and so bijective.

$Q(x,1)$ $\implies$ $x^2=f(x)f(f(x))$ and qo $Q(x,y)$ implies $f(x)f(yf(x))=x^2f(y)=f(x)f(y)f(f(x))$ and so $f(yf(x))=f(y)f(f(x))$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$

And  so, since surjective : $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ and $f(x)$ is multiplicative.

So $f(x)$ is an odd multiplicative bijection such that $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$
It's immediate then to get that $f(x)$ is additive
And then (classical result), since bijective, additive and multiplicative, we get $\boxed{S2: f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)-y)+f(x+y)=2x$
Let $g(x)=f(x)+x$
$P(x,y-x)$ becomes then new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(g(x)-y)=g(x)-g(y)+2x$

$Q(x,0)$ $\implies$ $g(g(x))=g(x)-g(0)+2x$ and so $g(x)$ is injective.
$Q(x,x)$ $\implies$ $g(g(x)-x)=2x$ and so $g(x)$ is surjective

Let then $u$ such that $g(u)=0$

a: $Q(x,-g(y))$ $\implies$ $g(g(x)+g(y))=g(x)-g(-g(y))+2x$
b: $Q(x,0)$ $\implies$ $g(g(x))=g(x)-g(0)+2x$
c: $Q(u,g(y))$ $\implies$ $g(-g(y))=-g(g(y))+2u$
a-b-c : $g(g(x)+g(y))=g(g(x))+g(g(y))-2u-g(0)$

And so, since surjective : $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)-2u-g(0)$
Setting then $x=y=0$, we get $u=0$ and so $g(0)=0$ and $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$

So problem is equivalent (look at $Q(x,y)$) to 
$g(x)$ is additive and such that $g(g(x))=g(x)+2x$

From there, it's easy to get the general solution :
Let $A,B$ two supplementary sub-vectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectordpace $\mathbb R$
Let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ so that $x=a(x)+b(x)$ in a unique way $\forall x$

Then $g(x)=2a(x)-b(x)$ and so $f(x)=a(x)-2b(x)$

Note this gives infinitely many solutions.
The only two continuous solutions are the trivial $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-2x$

I don't have the full solution (i am a beginner in ef) but I find some results 
$P\left ( x,\frac{f(x)-x}{2} \right )\Rightarrow f\left ( \frac{x+f(x)}{2} \right )=x$ then $f$ surjective.
and we have $P(x,0) \Rightarrow f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$ then $f(x)=f(y) \Rightarrow f(f(x))+f(x)=f(f(y))+f(y)  \Rightarrow x=y  \Rightarrow f$ injective.
therfore $f$ is a bijective function , so there is only one real $c$ such that $f(c)=0$ 
we have $P(0,f(0)+c)\Rightarrow f(f(0)+c)=0\Rightarrow f(0)+c=c\Rightarrow f(0)=0 \Rightarrow c=0$
$P(x,-x)\Rightarrow f(x+f(x))=2x$ then $P(x+f(x),0) \Rightarrow f(2x)+2x=2x+2f(x)\Rightarrow f(2x)=2f(x) $
and $P(0,x) \Rightarrow f(-x)=-f(x) \Rightarrow f$ is an odd function. (maybe can help  :maybe: )

I suppose second equation is true only for $x\ne -1$. If not : no solution.
If yes : first equaton implies $g(x)=2-x-f(1-2x)$

Plugging this in second equation, we get $f(\frac 1{x+1})-2f(1-\frac 1{x+1})=\frac 1{x+1}-1$

And so $f(x)-2f(1-x)=x-1$ $\forall x\ne 0$
And so, moving $x\to 1-x$ : $f(1-x)-2f(x)=-x$ $\forall x\ne 1$

Solving this system, we get $f(x)=\frac{x+1}3$ $\forall x\notin\{0,1\}$

Pluging $x=1$ in $f(x)-2f(1-x)=x-1$ $\forall x\ne 0$, we get $f(1)=2f(0)$

Hence the answer :

$f(0)=a$, $f(1)=2a$, $f(x)=\frac{x+1}3$ $\forall x\notin\{0,1\}$

$g(0)=2-2a$, $g(\frac 12)=\frac 32-a$, $g(x)=\frac{4-x}3$ $\forall x\notin\{0,\frac 12\}$

let $ x=y=a $ $ f(a+g(a))=f(a)+a , g(a+f(a))=g(a)-a $

so $ g(a)+a=g(a+f(a))+2a \Rightarrow f(g(a)+a)=f(g(a+f(a))+2a) $

let $ x=2a \Rightarrow \forall x \in \mathbb{R} f(x)=0 $

hence $ f \equiv 0 $

If $h\in(0,1)$, then $f(m,n)>0$ $\forall m,n\in\mathbb Z^+$ and $\sum_{m=1}^nf(m,n)=1-h$ and so $f(m,n)\in[0,1)$ and $h$ fits

If $h<0$, then $\lim_{n\to+\infty}f(n,n)=+\infty$ and $h$ does not fit

Hence the answer : $\boxed{h\in[0,1]}$

You can check it with induction.

Or you can write $f(m,n)=(1-h)^mh^{n-m}g(m,n)$ and equation becomes $g(m,n)=g(m,n-1)+g(m-1,n-1)$ and so ...

Clearly $f(x+3)=f(x)+35$ and breaks can occur only for rational numbers $x=\frac n{60}$

So we just have to compute the $180$ values $f(\frac n{60})$ for $n\in\{0,1,...,179\}$ and we get $\{0,1,2,4,5,6,7,$ $11,12,13,14,16,17,18,$ $19,23,24,25,26,28,29,30\}$

all integers equal to $\{0,1,2,4,5,6,7,$ $11,12,13,14,16,17,18,$ $19,23,24,25,26,28,29,30\}$ $\pmod{35}$ in $[0,f(100)=1166]$

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only fo non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))=$ $f(y)^4+4x^3f(y)+6x^2f(y)^2+4xf(y)^3+f(-x)$ $=(x+f(y))^4+f(-x)-x^4$
Let $a=f(0)$
Let $b$ such that $c=f(b)\ne 0$

The equation $4cx^3+6c^2x^2+4c^3x+c^4=t$ is a cubic (since $c\ne 0$) and so has at least a real solution $w$ whatever is $t$
Then $P(w,b)$ $\implies$ $f(w+c)-f(-w)=t$ and so any real $t$ may be written as $f(u)-f(v)$ for some $u,v$

$P(0,v)$ $\implies$ $f(f(v))=f(v)^4+a$
$P(f(v)-f(u),u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(v))=f(v)^4+f(f(u)-f(v))-(f(u)-f(v))^4$

Subtracting, we get $f(f(u)-f(v))=(f(u)-f(v))^4+a$ and so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x^4+a\text{   }\forall x}$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

Let $f(x)=g(x)+x$ and problem becomes assertion $P(x,y)$ : $g(x+g(y))=g(x)-g(y)$
We immediately get with induction $g(x+ng(y))=g(x)-ng(y)$ $\forall x,y\in\mathbb R$, $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

If $g(x)=0$ $\forall x$, we got a first solution $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=x\text{   }\forall x}$

If $\exists b$ such that $g(b)=c\ne 0$, the equation $g(x+nc)=g(x)-nc$ shows that $g(x)$ is neither upper-bounded, neither lower-bounded and so, since continuous, is surjective.
Then $P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $g(g(x))=g(0)-g(x)$ and, since surjective, $g(x)=a-x$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

And so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=a\text{   }\forall x}$

My solution is similar to pco's one but I still want to post it.

From the given equation, we can easily prove by induction that \[f\Big(x+n\cdot \big(f(y)-y\big)\Big)=f(x),\quad \forall x,\, y \in \mathbb R,\, n \in \mathbb Z.\quad (1)\] If $f(y) -y$ is surjective, then for each $t \in \mathbb R,$ there exists $y_0$ such that $t=f(y_0)-y_0.$ Plugging this into $(1)$ and taking $n=1,$ we get \[f(x+t)=f(x),\quad \forall x,\,t \in \mathbb R.\quad (2)\] So $f(x)\equiv c,\, \forall x \in \mathbb R$ and this is clearly a solution.

If $f(y)-y$ is not surjective, then its image should have one of the following forms: $[a,\,b],$ $(-\infty, \, a]$ or $[a,\, +\infty),$ due to the continuity.
[list][*] If $f(y)-y\in [a,\,b],\, \forall y \in \mathbb R,$ we have \[a+y \le f(y)\le b+y,\quad \forall y \in \mathbb R,\] from which it follows that $f$ is surjective due to the continuity. Since $f\big(f(y)\big)=f(y)$ (taking $x=0$ in the orginal equation), it follows that $f(x)=x,\, \forall x \in \mathbb R.$ This is a solution.
[*] If $f(y)-y \in (-\infty,\, a],\, \forall y \in \mathbb R,$ we have \[f(y)\le y+a,\quad \forall y \in \mathbb R.\] Using this result in $(1),$ we get \[n \cdot \big( f(y)-y\big)+a \ge f(x)-x,\quad \forall x,\, y \in \mathbb R,\, n \in \mathbb Z,\] which occurs only when $f(x)=x,\,\forall x \in \mathbb R$ and $a=0.$
[*] The last case $f(y)-y \in [a,\, +\infty),\, \forall y \in \mathbb R,$ we can use the same argument as above to obtain $f(x)=x,\, \forall x \in \mathbb R.$[\/list][\/list] Finally, we get $f(x)\equiv c$ and $f(x)=x$ are the solutions.

\[f(x+f(y)))=f(x)+\frac{1}{8}xf(4y)+f(f(y))\quad \forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+\frac 18xf(4y)+f(f(y))$
Let $a$ such that $f(a)=b\ne 0$
Let $c=\frac{f(4a)}{8b}$


$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$
$P(f(x),a)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)+b)=f(f(x))+\frac 18f(x)f(4a)+f(b)$
$P(b,x)$ $\implies$ $f(b+f(x))=f(b)+\frac 18bf(4x)+f(f(x))$
Subtracting, we get $f(4x)=8cf(x)$ and so $c\ne 0$ in this part of the proof.

And so $P(x,y)$ becomes new assertion $Q(x,y)$  : $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+cxf(y)+f(f(y))$

$Q(f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(x))=2f(f(x))+cf(x)^2$
$Q(2f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(3f(x))=3f(f(x))+3cf(x)^2$
$Q(3f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(4f(x))=4f(f(x))+6cf(x)^2$
And since we know that $f(4f(x))=8cf(f(x))$, last equation implies $(4c-2)f(f(x))=3cf(x)^2$
If $c=\frac 12$, this implies $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$, impossible in this part of the proof and so $c\ne \frac 12$ and $f(f(x))=\frac{3c}{2(2c-1)}f(x)^2$

Let then $d=\frac{3c}{2(2c-1)}$ and we get $f(f(x))=df(x)^2$ and so 
$Q(x,y)$ becomes new assertion $R(x,y)$ : $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+cxf(y)+df(y)^2$

$R(-f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(-f(x))=(c-d)f(x)^2$
$R(-2f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(-2f(x))=(3c-2d)f(x)^2$
$R(-3f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(-3f(x))=(6c-3d)f(x)^2$
$R(-4f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(-4f(x))=(10c-4d)f(x)^2$
And since we know that $f(-4f(x))=8cf(-f(x))=8c(c-d)f(x)^2$, we get $4c(c-d)=5c-2d$ and, since $d=\frac{3c}{2(2c-1)}$, this gives equation in $c$ :
$c(c-2)(2c-1)=0$ and so $c=2$ (we already wrote that $c\ne 0$ and $c\ne \frac 12$) and so $d=1$ 

And so $R(x,y)$ becomes new assertion $S(x,y)$ : $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+2xf(y)+f(y)^2$
$R(\frac{x-b^2}{2b},a)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{x-b^2}{2b}+b)-f(\frac{x-b^2}{2b})=x$ and so any real $x$ may be written as $x=f(u)-f(v)$ for some $u,v\in\mathbb R$

$R(-f(v),v)$ $\implies$ $f(-f(v))=f(v)^2$
$R(-f(v),u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(u)-f(v))=f(u)^2-2f(u)f(v)+f(v)^2$ $=(f(u)-f(v))^2$

And so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x^2\text{   }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution.

(a) Find $f(n)$.
(b) Find all solutions to $f(n)=n$.\end{tcolorbox}
If $n>2000$, $f(n)=n-12$
If $2000\ge n>1984$, then $n+16>2000$ and $f(n)=f(f(n+16))=f(n+4)$ and so $f(n)$ depends only on $n\pmod 4$ :
-- If $n\equiv 0\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=1992$
-- If $n\equiv 1\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=1989$
-- If $n\equiv 2\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=1990$
-- If $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=1991$
If $1984\ge n>1968$, then $2000\ge n+16>1984$ and so $f(n+16)\in\{1989,1990,1991,1992\}\subset (1984,2000]$ and so $f(n)$ depends only on $n\pmod 4$ :
-- If $n\equiv 0\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=f(f(n+16))=f(1992)=1992$
-- If $n\equiv 1\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=f(f(n+16))=f(1989)=1989$
-- If $n\equiv 2\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=f(f(n+16))=f(1990)=1990$
-- If $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$, then $f(n)=f(f(n+16))=f(1991)=1991$

If $n>2000$, $f(n)=n-12$
If $2000\ge n$, $f(n)=1989+\mod(n-1,4)$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all the functions $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}^+$ such that $f(x)f(y)=\beta f(x+yf(x)) \quad \forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}^+$ for a given $\beta \in\mathbb R ,\beta>1$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x)f(y)=\beta f(x+yf(x))$

1) $f(x)\ge \beta$ $\forall x$
=============
If $f(x)<1$ for some $x$, then $P(x,\frac x{1-f(x)})$ $\implies$ $f(x)=\beta>1$, impossible. So $f(x)\ge 1$ $\forall x$

If $f(x)\ge \beta^t$ $\forall x$ and for some $t\ge 0$; then $P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)^2\ge \beta^{1+t}$ and so $f(x)\ge \beta^{\frac{1+t}2}$ $\forall x$

Setting then $a_0=0$ and $a_{n+1}=\frac{1+a_n}2$, we get $f(x)\ge \beta^{a_n}$ $\forall x$, $\forall n$ and so $f(x)\ge \beta$ $\forall x$
Q.E.D.

2) If $f(u)=\beta$ for some $u>0$, then $f(x)=\beta$ $\forall x$
=====================================
If $f(u)=\beta$ for some $u>0$, then, for $x<u$ : $P(x,\frac{u-x}{f(x)})$ $\implies$ $f(x)f(\frac{u-x}{f(x)})=\beta^2$ and so $f(x)=\beta$ $\forall x\le u$

But $P(u,u)$ $\implies$ $f(u(1+\beta))=\beta$ and so $f(u(1+\beta)^n)=\beta$ and so, using previous line, $f(x)=\beta$ $\forall x$
Q.E.D.

3) $f(x)$ is not injective
================
If $f(x)$ is injective, comparaison of $P(x,1)$ with $P(1,x)$ implies $f(x+f(x))=f(1+xf(1))$ and so $x+f(x)=1+xf(1)$ and so $f(x)=1+x(f(1)-1)$
Plugging this back in original equation, we get $\beta=1$, impossible.
Q.E.D.

4) $f(x)=\beta$ $\forall x$
===============
Since non injective, let $a>b$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$. Then let $u=\frac{b-a}{f(a)}$ : $P(a,u)$ $\implies$ $f(u)=\beta$ 

Hence the result (using 2) above).

As usual for such functional equations, many equivalent general forms for solutions exist. Here is another one : 

$\boxed{f(x)=s(x+\frac 1x)e^{h(x)-h(\frac 1x)}}$ where $s(x)$ is any function from $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\to\{-1,+1\}$ and $h(x)$ is any function from $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb R$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f((x+y)^2)=(f(x)+f(y))^2$
Let $a=f(0)$

Obviously $f(x)\ge 0$ $\forall x\ge 0$

Subtracting $P(x+y,0)$ from $P(x,y)$, we get $(f(x+y)+a)^2=(f(x)+f(y))^2$ and so $f(x+y)+a=f(x)+f(y)$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$

So $f(x+y)-a=(f(x)-a)+(f(y)-a)$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$ and $f(x)-a$ is an additive lowerbounded function over $R^+$ and so is $cx$ for some $c\ge 0$

So $f(x)=cx+a$ $\forall x\ge 0$
Plugging this in original equation, we get $(c,a)\in\{(0,0),(0,\frac 14),(1,0)\}$

1) $(c,a)=(0,0)$ so that $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\ge 0$
===============================
$P(x,x)$ implies then $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$

2) $(c,a)=(0,\frac 14)$ so that $f(x)=\frac 14$ $\forall x\ge 0$
================================
$P(x,x)$ implies then $f(x)=\pm\frac 14$ $\forall x$
But if $f(u)=-\frac 14$ for some $u<0$, then $P(u,-u)$ implies contradiction  and so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=\frac 14\text{   }\forall x}$

3) $(c,a)=(1,0)$ so that $f(x)=x$ $\forall x\ge 0$
===============================
Let $x<0$ and any $y\ge -x$. $P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $(f(x)-x)(f(x)+x+2y)=0$ $\forall y\ge -x$ and so $\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=x\text{   }\forall x}$

Then it is easy  to find $f(r)=r$ for  all $r\in\mathbb{Q}$ and $f$ is increasing from $(***)$ and $(*).$  . If $f(u)>u$ for some u. Then there exists $r\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $f(u)>r>u$ then $f(u)<r$ contradiction then assuming $f(u)<u$ we get another contradiction.So $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=1\text{  }\forall x>0}$  is a solution
Let us from now look only for non allOne solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^y)=f(x)^{f(y)}$
Let $u>0$ such that $f(u)\ne 1$

Comparing $P(u^y,x)$ with $P(u,xy)$, we get $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ $\forall x,y$
Then $f(u)^{f(x)+f(y)}=f(u)^{f(x)}f(u)^{f(y)}$ $=f(u^x)f(u^y)$ $=f(u^{x+y})=f(u)^{f(x+y)}$ and so $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$

So $f(x)$ is positive, additive and multiplicative and it's very classical to get :

$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x>0}$  which indeed is a solution

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(x)+2y)=f(x^2)+f(y)+x+y-1$ 

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=1$

$P(x,-xf(x))$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=xf(x)-x+1$
$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(2x)=f(x)+x$

From there we'll compute two expressions for $f(4x^2)$ :
$f(2x)=f(x)+x$ $\implies$ $f(4x)=f(x)+3x$ $\implies$ $f(4x^2)=f(x^2)+3x^2$ $=xf(x)+3x^2-x+1$
$f(x^2)=xf(x)-x+1$ $\implies$ $f(4x^2)=2xf(2x)-2x+1$ $=2xf(x)+2x^2-2x+1$

So $xf(x)+3x^2-x+1=2xf(x)+2x^2-2x+1$ and so $x(f(x)-x-1)=0$ and so $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$

It's then easy to deduce from the fact that $f(x)$ is increasing that $g(x)=c$ is constant (look behaviour when $x\to+\infty$).

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x-y)f(x+y)=f(x)^2f(y)^2$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

$P(u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)^2=1$. Obviously $f(x)$ solution implies $-f(x)$ solution. So WLOG $f(0)=1$

If $f(x)=0$ for some $x$, then $P(\frac x2,\frac x2)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(\frac x2)^4$ and so $f(\frac x2)=0$ and so $f(\frac x{2^n})=0$ which is impossible since $f(0)=1$ and $f(x)$ is continuous.
So $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$ (since continuous) and we can define $g(x)=\ln f(x)$ and functional equation becomes :

New assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(x+y)+g(x-y)=2g(x)+2g(y)$ where $g(x)$ is continuous and $g(0)=0$

$Q((n+1)x,x)$ $\implies$ $g((n+2)x)=2g((n+1)x)-g(nx)+2g(x)$. From there, simple induction gives $g(nx)=n^2g(x)$ and so $g(x)=x^2g(1)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$

Continuity implies then $g(x)=ax^2$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

Hence the two last solutions :
$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=e^{ax^2}\text{   }\forall x}$ whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

$\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=-e^{ax^2}\text{   }\forall x}$ whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

How is $\frac{x+1}{xf(\frac{1}{x+1})} > 1$? We would require $f(\frac{1}{x+1}) < 1+\frac{1}{x}$ but that's obviously false.

Here's a solution. Denote $P(x,y)$ what it usually means.

Step 1. 
Assume that there exists an $y$ such that $yf(y)>1$. 
Now do a $P(\frac{1}{yf(y)-1},y)$. This gives a contradiction, since this forces $f(\frac{y}{f(\frac{1}{yf(y)-1}+1)}) = 0$.
Therefore, $yf(y) \le 1$ for all $y$.
This gives us $f(\frac{x+1}{xf(y)}) \le \frac{xf(y)}{x+1}$, so $\frac{f(x+1)}{y} \ge f(\frac{y}{f(x+1)}) \ge \frac{f(y)}{x+1}$.
Therefore, $(x+1)f(x+1) \ge yf(y)$, which gives us that $xf(x)=C \le 1$ for all $x>1$.

Step 2. 
We prove $C=1$. $P(x,y+1)$ gives you $f(\frac{y+1}{f(x+1)}) + f(\frac{x+1}{xf(y+1)}) = f(y+1)$.
This gives us $f(\frac{(x+1)(y+1)}{C}) + f(\frac{(x+1)(y+1)}{Cx}) = \frac{C}{y+1}$
Now since $C \le 1$, we have $\frac{(x+1)(y+1)}{C} \ge 1$ and $\frac{(x+1)(y+1)}{Cx} \ge 1$.
This gives us $\frac{C^2}{(x+1)(y+1)} + \frac{C^2x}{(x+1)(y+1)} = \frac{C}{y+1}$, which gives us $C^2=C$, or $C=1$.
Therefore, for $x>1$, we have $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$.
$P(x,1)$ gives you $f(\frac{1}{f(x+1)})+f(\frac{x+1}{xf(1)})=f(1)$.
Since $f(1) \le 1$, we have $\frac{x+1}{xf(1)} \ge 1$.
This gives us $\frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{xf(1)}{x+1} = f(1)$, so $f(1)=1$. This gives us $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ for $x \ge 1$.

Step 3. 
$P(x,\frac{x}{x+1})$ gives $f(\frac{x}{(x+1)f(x+1)}) + f(\frac{x+1}{xf(\frac{x}{x+1})}) = f(\frac{x}{x+1})$.
Now note that $f(\frac{x}{x+1}) \le \frac{x+1}{x}$, so $\frac{x+1}{xf(\frac{x}{x+1})} \ge 1$. 
This gives us $f(x)+\frac{x}{x+1}f(\frac{x}{x+1}) = f(\frac{x}{x+1})$, so $(x+1)f(x)=f(\frac{x}{x+1})$.
Let $x=\frac{k}{1-k}$, and this function of $0 \le k <1$ can express all reals.
This gives us $f(k)=\frac{1}{1-k}f(\frac{k}{1-k})$. 

Step 4. 
We prove that $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ holds for all $x<1$. 
To do this, we break the interval $(0,1)$ into intervals $[\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n})$ for all naturals $n$.

Base Case: $n=1$. Note that for $k \in [\frac{1}{2},1)$, $\frac{k}{1-k} > 1$.
This gives us $f(k)=\frac{1}{1-k}f(\frac{k}{1-k}) = \frac{1}{1-k} \cdot \frac{1-k}{k} = \frac{1}{k}$.

Inductive Step: Assume the statement for $n=l-1$. 
Note that for $k \in [\frac{1}{l+1},\frac{1}{l})$, we have $\frac{k}{1-k} \in [\frac{1}{l},\frac{1}{l-1})$.
This gives us, with the inductive hypothesis, that $f(k)=\frac{1}{1-k}f(\frac{k}{1-k}) = \frac{1}{1-k} \cdot \frac{1-k}{k} = \frac{1}{k}$.
This completes the proof of the statement for $n=l$.

Given any real $\epsilon < 1$, it is enclosed in some interval in a form of $[\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n})$.
Therefore, for all $x<1$, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. Therefore, we conclude that $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. Verification is easy. GG. $\blacksquare$

[hide=Solution]

[hide=Answer] We claim that the only such function is $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$. Clearly, it satisfies the given condition, so we only need to show that no other function does. [\/hide]

[hide=Notation] Let $P(x,y)$ denote the assertion $$f\left(\frac{y}{f(x+1)}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{xf(y)}\right)=f(y)$$ for all $x,y>0$.
[\/hide]

[hide=Prelim 1] \begin{bolded}Lemma 1:\end{bolded} $xf(x) \le 1$ for all $x>0$.

\begin{italicized}Proof:\end{italicized} Fix $y>0$ such that $yf(y)>1$. From $P\left(\frac{1}{yf(y)-1},y\right)$ we conclude that $$f\left(\frac{y}{f\left(1+\frac{1}{yf(y)-1}\right)}\right)=0$$ contradicting that $0$ is not in the co-domain of $f$. $\square$

[\/hide]

[hide=Prelim 2] \begin{bolded}Lemma 2:\end{bolded} $f(a)=\frac{1}{a}$ for all $a>1$.

\begin{italicized}Proof:\end{italicized} Fix reals $x,z>0$ and $y=1+z>1$. From the fact that $tf(t) \le 1$ for all $t$, $P(x,y)$ yields $$\frac{f(x+1)}{y}+\frac{xf(y)}{x+1} \ge f\left(\frac{y}{f(x+1)}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{xf(y)}\right)=f(y) \Longrightarrow (x+1)f(x+1) \ge (1+z)f(1+z).$$ The same argument with $P(y,x)$ yields that $(1+z)f(1+z) \ge (1+x)f(1+x)$, whence, $af(a)=c \le 1$ for all $a>1$ where $c$ is a constant. Since the equality holds in the last equation, we have $$f\left(\frac{y}{f(x+1)}\right)=\frac{f(x+1)}{y} \Longrightarrow \frac{c^2}{y(1+x)}=\frac{c}{(1+x)y} \Longrightarrow c=1. \, \square$$

[\/hide]

[hide=Prelim 3] \begin{bolded}Lemma 3:\end{bolded} $f$ is strictly decreasing.

\begin{italicized}Proof: \end{italicized} Note that by \begin{bolded}Lemma 2\end{bolded} the assertion $P(x,y)$ can be rephrased as $$f(y(1+x))+f\left(\frac{x+1}{xf(y)}\right)=f(y).$$ For any $z>y$ set $x=\frac{z-y}{y}>0$ and we have $f(z)<f(y)$ as desired. $\square$
[\/hide]

[hide=Prelim 4] \begin{bolded}Lemma 4:\end{bolded} $f(a)=\frac{1}{a}$ for all $a \ge \frac{1}{2}$.

\begin{italicized}Proof:\end{italicized} Note that for any $\epsilon>0$ we have $\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}=f(1+\epsilon)<f(1) \le 1$ and by taking $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ we get that $f(1)=1$. Pick $\frac{1}{2}<y<1$ and note that $f(y)>f(1)=1$. Note that $$y>1-y \Longrightarrow f(y) \le \frac{1}{y}<\frac{1}{1-y} \Longrightarrow \left(1-\frac{1}{y}\right)<\frac{1}{f(y)-1}$$ and so we can choose a positive real $x$ such that $$\left(1-\frac{1}{y}\right)<x<\frac{1}{f(y)-1} \Longrightarrow \frac{x+1}{xf(y)}>1, \qquad y(1+x)>1 \Longrightarrow f(y)=\frac{1}{y}$$ for all $y>\frac{1}{2}$ wherein the last implication holds by \begin{bolded}Lemma 2.\end{bolded} Finally, we have $$\frac{2}{1+2\epsilon}=f\left(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon \right)<f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \le 2$$ and letting $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ we get that $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=2$. $\square$

[\/hide]

[hide=Endgame] \begin{bolded}Conclusion:\end{bolded} Iterating the argument applied in \begin{bolded}Lemma 4,\end{bolded} one may by induction on $n \ge 1$ that for all $y \in \left[\frac{1}{2^n}, \infty \right)$, $f(y)=\frac{1}{y}$. From this we conclude that $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$. $\square$

We know that solutions of $f(x)-x=0$ are solutions, and so quartic is divisble by $x^2-(2m+1)x+m^2+1$ and factorization of quartic becomes then easy.

So $(x-m)^2\ge m-1$  and $(x^2-(2m+1)x+m^2+1)(x^2-(2m-1)x +m^2-2m+2)=0$

So $(x-m)^2\ge m-1$  and $x\in\left\{\frac{2m+1\pm\sqrt{4m-3}}2,\frac{2m-1\pm\sqrt{4m-7}}2\right\}$ whence these values are defined.

Hence the solutions :
If $m=1$, then two solutions : $x\in\{1,2\}$

If $m\in(1,2)$, then one solution $x=\frac{2m+1+\sqrt{4m-3}}2$

If $m\in[2,+\infty)$, then two solutions $x\in\left\{\frac{2m+1+\sqrt{4m-3}}2,\frac{2m-1-\sqrt{4m-7}}2\right\}$

Let $f(x)=g(x)+1$ and functional equation may be written (moving $x\to2x$ and $y\to 2y$) :

I dont understand the question.

In a general way, we can never assert that a function is a polynomial if this is not explicitely stated in the problem sentences.

	Find all functions $f: \mathbb{Q}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ $ with the property:

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f: \mathbb{Q}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ $ with the property:
\[f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y)) \,,\, \forall x,y \in \mathbb{Q}^+\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))$
Let $a=f(1)$

$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2)=\frac 12$
$P(2,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=\frac 1{2a+1}$
$P(3,1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=\frac 1{2a^2+a+1}$
$P(4,1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=\frac 1{2a^3+a^2+a+1}$

$P(2,3)$ $\implies$ $f(6)=f(5)(f(2)+f(3))$
$P(5,1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=f(6)(f(1)+f(5)$ and so $(f(2)+f(3))(f(1)+f(5))=1$

Using values got previously in this equation and simplifying, we get $(a-1)(a+1)(2a-1)(2a^2+a+1)=0$ and so $a\in\{\frac 12,1\}$

1) If $a=1$
=========
$P(n,1)$ $\implies$ $\frac 1{f(n+1)}=\frac 1{f(n)}+1$ and a simple induction gives $f(n)=\frac 1n$

$P(x+n,1)$ $\implies$ $\frac 1{f(x+n+1}=1+\frac 1{f(x+n)}$ and a simple induction gives then $f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1}$

$P(x,n)$ $\implies$ $f(nx)=\frac{f(x)}n$ and so $f(\frac pq)=\frac qp$ and so :

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=\frac 1x\text{  }\forall x\in\mathbb Q^+}$ which indeed is a solution.


2) If $a=\frac 12$
==============
$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=\frac{2f(x)}{2f(x)+1}$ and a simple induction implies $f(n)=\frac 12$

This also implies $f(x+2)=\frac {4f(x)}{6f(x)+1}$ and $f(x+4)=\frac{16f(x)}{30f(x)+1}$

Then $P(x,2)$ $\implies$ $f(2x)=\frac{2f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{6f(x)+1}$ and $P(2x,2)$ $\implies$ $f(4x)=\frac{4f(x)(2f(x)+1)(8f(x)^2+10f(x)+1)}{(6f(x)+1)(24f(x)^2+18f(x)+1)}$

But $P(x,4)$ $\implies$ $f(4x)=\frac{8f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{30f(x)+1}$

Equating these two expressions of $f(4x)$, we get $(2f(x)-1)^2(12f(x)+1)=0$ and so :

$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=\frac 12\text{  }\forall x\in\mathbb Q^+}$ which indeed is a solution.

	Now let's make this more challenging (and this was the original problem of Nikolai Nikolov): same question with rational numbers replaced with positive real numbers.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/96532}{dgrozev}]
	Yes, the author of the problem is Nikolay Nikolov. It was given at the competition in the form as it have been posted here. To the extent that I have seen, the more complicated version was: 
Find all functions $ f: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}$ with the same property.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/285}{harazi}]
	Let's find the functions $f:(0,\infty)\to \mathbf{R}$ such that 
  \[f(xy)=f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y)).\] This is the original version of the problem, apparently submitted to IMO last year and rejected since considered too hard. My solution is pretty long.
  
   Step 1: Let $Z$ be the set of zeros of $f$ and suppose that $S$ is nonempty and 
   $f$ is not the zero map. Observe that:
   
   1) If $x,y\in S$, then $xy\in S$. 
   
   2) If $x\in S$, then $u\in S$ for all $u\in (0, x^2\/4]$. Indeed, for any such $u$ we can find 
   $0<y<x$ such that $ u=y(x-y)$ and then $f(u)=f(x)(f(y)+f(x-y))=0$. 
   
     Hence, if $x\in S$ and $n\geq 1$, then $(0, x^{2n}\/4]\subset S$. If $x>1$, then by choosing 
     $n$ very large we obtain that $(0, A]\subset S$ for all $A>0$, so $f=0$, contradiction. Hence 
     $S\subset (0, 1]$. Observation 2) above shows that we can find $y_1<y_2$ in $S$.
     Set $x=y_2\/y_1>1$, so that $f(y_2)=f(xy_1)=f(x+y_1)f(x)\ne 0$ (because $x>1$ and $x+y_1>1$), a contradiction. 
     
     This shows that if $f$ vanishes at some point, then $f$ is the zero map. From now on I will suppose that 
     $f$ is not the zero map. Since $f(1)=2f(2) f(1)$, we have $f(2)=1\/2$.
     
    Step 2. I claim that $f(1)\in \{1, -1, 1\/2\}$. Let $\alpha=f(1)\ne 0$ and suppose that 
    $\alpha\ne 1, 1\/2$. Set $x_n=1\/f(n)$. Taking $x=n, y=1$, we obtain 
    $f(n)=f(n+1)(f(n)+\alpha)$, hence $x_{n+1}=1+\alpha x_n$.  This gives us explicit values for 
    $x_n$ in terms of $\alpha$. In particular, we find $x_3=1+2\alpha$,
    $x_5=1+\alpha+\alpha^2+2\alpha^3$ and $x_6=1+\alpha+\alpha^2+\alpha^3+2\alpha^4$.
    Now, we have \[f(6)=f(2\cdot 3)=f(5)( 1\/2+f(3)).\]
    Writing this in terms of $x_3, x_5, x_6$ and using the above formulae we arrive at the nasty equation 
    \[ 3\alpha^3+\alpha^2+\alpha= 4\alpha^5+1.\]
     This factors as \[ (\alpha^2-1)(2\alpha-1)(2\alpha^2+\alpha+1)=0\]
     and finishes the proof of step $2$. 
     
     Step 3. We consider the case $f(1)=1$. Then $f(x+1)=\frac{f(x)}{f(x)+1}$ (take $y=1$),
     so $f(x+2)=\frac{f(x)}{2f(x)+1}$. Taking $y=2$ we obtain 
     \[f(2x)=f(x+2)(f(x)+1\/2)=\frac{f(x)}{2}.\]
     Taking $y=x$ and using the previous relation we also obtain $f(x^2)=f(x)^2$. In particular 
     $f(x)>0$ for all $x$. Next, by induction we have $f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1}<\frac{1}{n}$ and $f(n)=1\/n$.
     which shows that $f(x)\leq 1\/n$ for $x\geq n$. Hence for all $x\geq 1$ we have $f(x)\leq 1\/[x]$. 
     But then for all $x>1$ we have \[f(x)^{2^n}=f(x^{2^n})\leq 1\/[x^{2^n}].\]
       Taking the $2^n$th root and passing to the limit we finally obtain $f(x)\leq 1\/x$ for 
       $x\geq 1$. But since $f(2^n x)= f(x)\/2^n$, we get $f(x)\leq 1\/x$ for all $x\geq 2^{-n}$ and this for all 
       $n$, hence $f(x)\leq 1\/x$ for all $x$. Combined with the relation 
       \[ 1=f(1)= f(x+1\/x)(f(x)+f(1\/x))\]
       this immediately implies $f(x)=1\/x$ for all $x$. So we get another solution, the map 
       $x\to 1\/x$, unique solution for which $f(1)=1$.
       
       Step 4.  We consider the case $f(1)=1\/2$. This time 
       $f(x+1)= \frac{f(x)}{f(x)+1\/2}$ and by induction we get 
       \[f(x+n)=\frac{2^n f(x)}{2 (2^n-1) f(x)+1},\]
       in particular $f(n)=1\/2$ for positive integers $n$ and 
       $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(x+n)=1\/2$. Next, we have        
       $f(nx)= f(x+n)(f(x)+1\/2)$, and this tends to $ 1\/2 (f(x)+1\/2)$ when 
       $n\to\infty$. Hence for all positive integers $m$ we have 
       \[ 1\/2 ( f(mx)+1\/2)=\lim_{n\to\infty} f(mnx)=\lim_{n\to\infty} f(nx)=
       1\/2(f(x)+1\/2),\]
        hence $f(mx)=f(x)$ for all $x$ and all positive integers $m$. Making again 
        $m\to\infty$ we obtain $f(x)=\lim_{m} f(mx)= 1\/2 (f(x)+1\/2)$, hence 
        $f(x)=1\/2$ for all $x$. This gives another solution to the problem.
        
       Step 5. I consider the case $f(1)=-1$ and I claim that there is no solution in this case. 
       Now, we have $f(x+1)= \frac{f(x)}{f(x)-1}$ and replacing $x$ by $x+1$ we obtain
       $f(x)=f(x+2)$. This gives in particular $f(4)=f(2)=1\/2$ and also 
       \[ f(2x)= f(x+2)(f(x)+1\/2)=f(x) (f(x)+1\/2),  f(4x)=f(x+4)(f(x)+1\/2)=f(x) (f(x)+1\/2).\]
       Hence $f(2x)=f(4x)$ for all $x$ and so $f(x)=f(2x)=f(x)(f(x)+1\/2)$ for all $x$, which gives 
       $f(x)+1\/2=1$ for all $x$, a contradiction.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/167924}{utkarshgupta}]
	I have reached somewhere at least.
For f(x) be an identity function,
Clearly $f(x)=0$ is a solution.


Let $f(x)$ not be a constant function and let for some $s \neq 0$ $f(s)=0$.
Then $f(sy)=f(s)f(y)=0$ for all $y$ implying $f(x)$ is identically $0$.
A contradiction!

Thus only $f(0)=0$
Also $f(0)=f(x)+f(-x)$ i.e. $f(x)=f(-x)$.
$f(1)=(f(1))^2$ Thus $f(1)=1$
An easy induction shows that $f(nx)=nf(x)$ where $n \in N$ (from left function)
That is $f(n)=n$ for $n \in N$
Now for $n \in N$ $f(nx)=f(n)f(x)=nf(x)$ where $x \in Q^{+}$ and $nx \in N$
That is $f(x)=\frac{f(nx)}{n}=\frac{nx}{n}=x$.

Thus we have shown $f(x)=x$ for all $x \in Q$ (since also we have $f(x)=-f(x)$
Again an easy induction on the right function shows that $f(x^n)=(f(x))^n$ for $n \in  N$.
Now for $x$ and $n$ where $x^n$ is an integer we have $f(x)=f(x^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}={x^n}^{\frac{1}{n}}=x$
I think this shows the solution.

AM I RIGHT?

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/31919}{tenniskidperson3}]
	A problem is that $f(\sqrt{2})^2=f(2)$, but is $f(\sqrt{2})=\sqrt{2}$ or $-\sqrt{2}$?  The point is that it can't be $-\sqrt{2}$ because $f(\sqrt[4]{2})^2=f(\sqrt{2})$, so $f(\sqrt{2})\geq 0$.  This is how you prove it for transcendental numbers, too: for any $x\geq 0$, say $y^2=x$, then $0\leq f(y)^2=f(y^2)=f(x)$.  And then $f(x+z)=f(x)+f(z)\geq f(z)$ if $x\geq 0$, so $f$ is an increasing function.

Now you use the fact that every real is a supremum and infimum of sets of rationals, and pick a sequence of increasing rationals and a sequence of decreasing rational numbers both converging to some real $x$.  You know that applying $f(x)$ must be trapped between the numbers obtained when applying $f$ to each of these sequences, and the only such real number is $x$.  Thus $f(x)=x$ for any arbitrary real number.

Second equation means $f(x)\ge 0$ $\forall x\ge 0$ and so we have an additive locally lower bounded function, so continuous.

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x\text{ and any }g(x)}$ is always a solution.
So let us from now look only for non allzero functions $f(x)$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)=f(x)g(y)+f(y)$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

Subtracting $P(u,x)$ from $P(x,u)$, we get $g(x)=af(x)+1$ for some $a=\frac{g(u)-1}{f(u)}$

If $a=0$, we get $g(x)=1$ $\forall x$ and $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and the solution :
$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=\text{ any additive function and }g(x)=1\text{   }\forall x}$

If $a\ne 0$, we get $g(x+y)=g(x)g(y)$ whose solutions are very classical  : $g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and $g(x)=e^{u(x)}$ where $u(x)$ is any additive function.

Hence the solutions :

$f(x)$ is even. Let then $g(x)$ from $[1,+\infty)\to \mathbb R$ as $g(x)=f(\sqrt{x-1})=f(-\sqrt{x-1})$ and we get $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+xy)=f(x)+f(x)f(y)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$

If $f(-1)\ne -1$, $P(0,-1)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution

If $f(1)=0$, $P(1,x-1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$, already found

If $f(-1)=-1$ and $f(1)\ne 0$, Let $f(x)=f(1)g(x)$. then :
$P(1,y-1)$ $\implies$ $g(y)=1+f(1)g(y-1)$
$P(x,y-1)$ $\implies$ $g(xy)=g(x)(1+f(1)g(y-1))$ and so $g(xy)=g(x)g(y)$ with four classical solutions :

$g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ which unfortunately is not a solution in this part of the proof.

$g(x)=1$ $\forall x$ which unfortunately is not a solution in this part of the proof.

$g(0)=0$ and $g(x)=|x|^a$ $\forall x\ne 0$ which unfortunately is not a solution in this part of the proof.

$g(0)=0$ and $g(x)=\text{sign}(x)|x|^a$ $\forall x\ne 0$ which is a solution only when $a=1$ and gives $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x\text{   }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x-f(y))=f(x)+xf(y)+f(f(y))$, true $\forall x,y\in\mathbb R$
Let $c=f(0$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

$P(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)},u)$ $\implies$ $x=f(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)}-f(u))-f(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)})$ and so any $x$ may be written as $x=f(a)-f(b)$ for some $a,b$

(1) : $P(f(a),a)$ $\implies$ $\frac c2=f(f(a))+\frac 12f(a)^2$
(2) : $P(f(b),b)$ $\implies$ $\frac c2=f(f(b))+\frac 12f(b)^2$
(3) : $P(f(a),b)$ $\implies$ $f(f(a)-f(b))=f(f(a))+f(a)f(b)+f(f(b))$
(3)-(1)-(2) : $f(f(a)-f(b))=c-\frac 12(f(a)-f(b))^2$ and so $f(x)=c-\frac 12x^2$

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $c=0$ and the solution $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=-\frac{x^2}2\text{   }\forall x}$

Your hint was to prove that $f(x)-f(y)$ was surjective, which is not always true.

So which is wrong.

So bad, or at least dishonest hint.

In my personal opinion.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/213306}{saturzo}]
	Let $P(x, y)$ be the assertion $f(x-f(y))=f(x)+xf(y)+f(f(y)), \forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ [the problem statement is actually this].
One solution is clearly $f(x)=0, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$.
Let's, now, assume that $\exists u \in \mathbb{R} : f(u) \neq 0$.
$P(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)}, u) : f(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)}-f(u)) - f(\frac{x-f(f(u))}{f(u)}) = x, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
$\therefore \left\{f(x)-f(y):x,y \in \mathbb{R}\right\} = \mathbb{R}$
Again $P(f(x), y) : f(f(x)-f(y)) = f((x)) + f(x)f(y) + f(f(y)) = f(f(y)-f(x)) [$ interchanging $x$ and $y]$
$\therefore f(x)=f(-x), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
Using this, $P(0, y) : f(-f(y))=f(0)+f(f(y))=f(f(y)) \implies f(0)=0$
Now, $P(f(x), x) : f(f(x))=-\frac{f(x)^2}{2}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$.
Using all these, we get:
$P(f(x), y): f(f(x)-f(y))=-\frac{f(x)^2}{2}+f(x)f(y)-\frac{f(y)^2}{2} = -\frac{(f(x)-f(y))^2}{2}$
$\therefore f(x) = -\frac{x^2}{2}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ -- which is clearly another solution!


$NB:$ I got the idea to prove $\left\{f(x)-f(y):x,y \in \mathbb{R}\right\} = \mathbb{R}$ from the IMO-6 of 1999 :D

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/172163}{joybangla}]
	A well known technique. From which year is this one? I hope $1983$ because otherwise it is sad. 
$f(1\cdot 1)=f(1)^2\implies f(1)=0,1$. See if $f(1)=0$ then $f\equiv 0$ and thus rejected. Suppose $f(1)=1$. Anyways we prove for powers of $2$. And fill the gaps afterwards. Trivially from multiplicativity we have $f(2^k)=2^k$ for all $k\ge 0$. Now suppose $f(m)=\ell$ for some $m>1$. Now $f(m)>1$ so $\ell$ is positive. Using multiplicativity we get $f(m^n)=\ell^n$ for all $n$. Let for some $n$, we have $2^k<m^n<2^{k+1}$. Now we have $2^k<\ell^n<2^{k+1}$. Thus we have $\frac{1}{2}<\left(\frac{m}{\ell}\right)^n<2$. Clearly this is our contradiction. If $m>\ell$ take $n>\frac{\ell}{m-\ell}$ and apply Bernoulli's inequality to get :
\[ \left(\frac{m}{\ell}\right)^n=\left(1+\frac{m-\ell}{\ell}\right)^n>1+n\left(\frac{m-\ell}{\ell}\right)>2 \]
And if $\ell>m$ take $n>\frac{m}{\ell-m}$ and apply Bernoulli's inequality again :
\[ \left(\frac{\ell}{m}\right)^n=\left(1+\frac{\ell-m}{m}\right)^n>1+n\left(\frac{\ell-m}{m}\right)>2 \]
Both lead to a contradiction. Thus the only solution is $f\equiv \text{id}_{\mathbb{N}}$. Thus $f(1983)=1983$
So only possible value of $f(1983)$ is $1983$. I suppose this is not too boring for you.....

	Or just that $ f(mn)=f(m)f(n) $ is one one the four famous Cauchy functional equations, that admit only the solutions $ f(x)=x^c $ , but since $ f(2)=2 $ you get $ c=1 $, thus $ f(1983)=1983 $.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)-2y)=2x-3y+f(f(y)-x)$
Let $a=f(0)$

$P(f(x),x)$ $\implies$  $f(f(f(x))-2x)=2f(x)-3x+a$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(a-x)=f(f(x))-2x$ $\implies$ $f(f(a-x))=f(f(f(x))-2x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(a-x))=2f(x)-3x+a$

$P(a-x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(a-x))=2a-2x+f(x)$

And so $2f(x)-3x+a=2a-2x+f(x)$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x+a}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

Let $g(x)=x^3+x$ : $g(x)$ is an increasing bijection from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ and so $\exists$ $g^{-1}(x)$ increasing bijection too.

$f(g(x))\le x$ $\implies$ $f(x)\le g^{-1}(x)$

Setting $n=1$ in b., we get $f(1)\in\{0,1\}$

Writing $f(n)=n^2-g(n)^2$ for some $g(n)\in[0,n]$, first equation implies

$f(n)+f(1)\ge f(n+1)-1$ $\forall n\ge 1$ and so $g(n+1)^2\ge g(n)^2+2n-f(1)>g(n)^2$ $\forall n\ge 1$

$2\ge g(2)>g(1)$ and so $g(2)\in\{1,2\}$

If $g(2)=2$, we get $g(n)=n$ $\forall n\ge 2$ and so $f(n)=0$ $\forall n\ge 2$ and the two solutions ;

$P(1)$ in condition b. so we get $1-f(1)=x^{2}$ so $f(1)=1$
$P(2)$ in b. and we easly get $f(2)=3$.
$P(3)$ in b. and we get $f(3)=5$ so let's try to prove $f(x)=2x-1$.
$P(m,1)$ in a. $f(m+1)-1|f(m)+1$ so let $f(m)+1=k(f(m+1)-1$
Now if $k>1$ we  get $f(m+1)<f(m)$

\begin{bolded}1. step\end{bolded}$f(2)=3=f(1)+2$
\begin{bolded}2.nd step\end{bolded}For every $n$ we have $f(n+1)=f(n)+2$ so we easy by induction get $f(n+1)=2(n+1)-1=2n+1$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{Q}$ such that 
\[ f(x+3f(y))=f(x)+f(y)+2y \quad \forall x,y\in \mathbb{Q}\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+3f(y))=f(x)+f(y)+2y$
$f(x)$ is injective
$P(x-3f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f(x-3f(x))=-2x$ and $f(x)$ is surjective.

Let $u=f^{-1}(0)$. $P(u,u)$ $\implies$ $u=0$

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(3f(x))=f(x)+2x$
$P(-3f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $-f(-3f(x))=f(x)+2x$

So, since surjective, $f(-x)=-f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is an odd funcion


$P(x,-\frac{f(x)}2)$ $\implies$ $f(x+3f(-\frac{f(x)}2))=f(-\frac{f(x)}2)$ and so, since injective,  $x+3f(-\frac{f(x)}2)=-\frac{f(x)}2$
And so $6f(\frac{f(x)}2)=f(x)+2x$

So $f(3f(x))=6f(\frac{f(x)}2)$ and so, since surjective,  $f(6x)=6f(x)$ 

$P(3f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $6f(f(x))=f(3f(x))+f(x)+2x=2f(3f(x))$ and so, since surjective, $f(3x)=3f(x)$ and sio $f(2x)=2f(x)$

From there :
$P(nf(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f((n+3)f(x))=f(nf(x))+f(f(x))+2x$
$P((n+1)f(x),x)$ $\implies$ $f((n+4)f(x))=f((n+1)f(x))+f(f(x))+2x$
Subtracting, we get $f((n+4)f(x))-f((n+3)f(x))=f((n+1)f(x))-f(nf(x))$ and, since surjective, $f((n+4)x)-f((n+3)x)=f((n+1)x)-f(nx)$

And since we previously got $f(3x)-f(2x)=f(2x)-f(x)=f(x)-f(0)$, we get with induction $f(nx)=nf(x)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$, $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$

So $f(x)=ax$, and plugging back in original equation, $a\in\{1,-\frac 23\}$

Hence the solutions $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=x\text{   }\forall x\in\mathbb Q}$ and $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=-\frac{2x}3\text{   }\forall x\in\mathbb Q}$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/86115}{Mahi}]
	Or, after we have $f(x)$ surjective, and $f(0) = 0$,
$P(0,y) \Rightarrow f(3f(y)) = f(y)+2y$
and thus, we have $f(x+3f(y)) = f(x)+f(3f(y))$
As we know $f(x)$ to be surjective, replacing $3f(y)$ with $y$, $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$, and thus $f(x)=ax \forall x \in \mathbb Q$, and setting it in the original equation we get $a = 1$ or $-\frac 23$.

Maybe it would have been easier to brake it down to cases. Thanks for your comment, I'm here to improve my skills of presenting proofs.

Case $f(n^\ast-1)>f(n^\ast)$: Since $f(n-1)-f(n) \geq f(n)-f(n+1)$ for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, $f(n^\ast-1-k)\geq f(n^\ast-1)+k(f(n^\ast-1)-f(n^\ast))$.

Let $g(x)=2x-\frac{f(x)}{\alpha}$ and equation becomes $g(g(x))=2g(x)-1$ $\forall x$ and so $g(x)=2x-1$ $\forall x\in g(\mathbb R)$

2) either $g(\mathbb R)=\{1\}$ and we get the solution $g(x)=1$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=\alpha(2x-1)}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

3) either $g(\mathbb R)=[a,+\infty)$ for some $a\ge 1$ and we get the solution :
$g(x)=2x-1$ $\forall x\ge a$ and $g(x)$ is any value $\ge a$ $\forall x<a$ and so :

Let $A,B$ two supplementary subvectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ (so that $x=a(x)+b(x)$ in a unique manner).

It's very classical to build a bijection from $[0,1)X[0,1)\to[0,1)$ :

Take the normalized binary representations of $x,y$ (not ending with infinite sequence of 1s) and build the binary representation of $z=f(x,y)$ as following :

Copy all binary digits of $x$ to $z$ up and including the first $0$
Copy then all binary digits of $y$ to $z$ up and including the first $0$
Back to $x$, copy all binary digits of $x$ to $z$ from the first uncopied digit up and including the first $0$
Back to $y$, copy all binary digits of $x$ to $z$ from the first uncopied digit up and including the first $0$
and so on.

And since there are simple bijections from $[0,1)\to\mathbb R$ and from $\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb C$, end of problem.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/89198}{chaotic_iak}]
	Express $n$ in binary and compact any string of identical digits into only one such digit. For example, $2011_{10} = 11111011011_2$, so $f(2011_{10}) = 10101_2 = 21_{10}$. This can be verified easily using the given four recurrences.

Thus since $f(2011) = 10101_2$, we need to find the number of positive integers less than $2011$ that has the pattern $1\ldots 10\ldots 01\ldots 10\ldots 01\ldots 1_2$.

This can be done as follows. Since $2011$ has $11$ binary digits, we can think of a string in the form $0\ldots 01\ldots 10\ldots 01\ldots 10\ldots 01\ldots 1_2$ with $12$ digits and evaluate its value. Thus letting the lengths of consecutive identical digits be $a,b,c,d,e,f$ in order, we need to find the number of solutions for $a+b+c+d+e+f = 12$ where $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are positive integers. There are $\binom{12-1}{6-1} = 462$ such numbers. However, some of these numbers exceed $2011$; we need to manually compute the number of integers greater than or equal to $2011$ that has the same pattern, and remove the count. If I count correctly, there are $7$ such numbers, so there are $462 - 7 = \boxed{455}$ numbers satisfying the condition.

Find the number of positive integers $n$ which are less than $2011$ and

It is easy to see that $f(n)$ is $n$ wher all consecutive ones are replaced by a unique one and all consecutive zeroes are replaced by a single zero.

For example : $f(\overline{110000111001}_2=\overline{10101}_2)$ 

So $f(2011)=f(\overline{11111011011}_2=\overline{10101}_2=21$

So required number is the number of $11$ bits numbers with exactly 5 changes in the sequence of binary digits ($\binom{11}5=462$) minus the numbers greater than or equal to 2011 :
$\overline{11111011011}_2$
$\overline{11111011101}_2$
$\overline{11111100101}_2$

$\overline{11111101011}_2$
$\overline{11111101101}_2$
$\overline{11111110101}_2$

If $f(a)=f(b)$ we obtain that $\displaystyle \frac{a+1}{a^2}=\frac{b+1}{b^2}$, so $a=b$ and $f$ is injective.

$P(1,1)$ we obtain $f(1)=f(f(1)) \Rightarrow f(1)=1$

$P(4)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=4$
From there, it's easy to show that $f(n)>2$ $\forall n>2$ and so that $f(1)=2$ and $f(n)$ is uniquely determined.
It's then rather easy to check that $\boxed{f(n)=2+\left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt 5-1}2(n-1)\right\rfloor}$ is the unique solution in this case

Case 3 : If $f(2)=3$
==============
$P(2)$ $\implies$ $2f(3)=5$, impossible


Case 4 : If $f(2)\ge 4$
================
$P(1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(1))\le 0$, impossible



And so a unique solution.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)+yz)=x^3+f(y)f(z)$  for all reals $x,y,z$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)+yz)=x^3+f(y)f(z)$

If $f(0)\ne 0$, $P(0,0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=c$ constant, which is never a solution. So $f(0)=0$

$P(0,x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ and $f(x)$ is multiplicative.

$P(\sqrt[3]x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(\sqrt[3]x))=x$

(1) : $P(f(\sqrt[3]x),y,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+y)=f(\sqrt[3]x)^3+f(y)f(1)$
(2) : $P(f(\sqrt[3]x),0,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(\sqrt[3]x)^3$
(3) : $P(0,y,1)$ $\implies$ $f(y)=f(y)f(1)$
(1)-(2)-(3) $\implies$ $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and so $f(x)$ is additive.

And so, since non constant, additive and multiplicative, we classicaly get $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution.

I do not think $f(x)=x$ is a solution.

Another very similar solution
Let $P(x,y,z)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)+yz)=x^3+f(y)f(z)$
Obviously $f$ is bijective so there exist real number $a$ such that $f(a)=0$
$P(a,a,1)$ yields $f(0)=0$
$P(x,0,z)$ yields $f(f(x))=x^3$
$P(0,y,z)$ yields $f(y)f(z)=f(yz)$ so $f$ is multiplicative
Now $f(f(x)+yz)=x^3+f(y)f(z)=f(f(x))+f(y)f(z)=f(f(x))+f(yz)$ and since $f$ is surjective we get $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ so $f$ is additive
And now since function is additive, multiplicative and bijective yields $f(x)=x$ which unfortunately is not a solution. So no solution exist.

	\begin{tcolorbox}find all functions f:R->R such that:

At first, we consider the function $ g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ such that $ g(x)=2f(x) $

Then the condition becomes $ g(x^2+g(y))=y+g(x)^2 $

Let $ P(x,y) $ be the assertion of $ g(x^2+g(y))=y+g(x)^2 $

$ P(x,0),P(0,y) \Rightarrow g(x^2+y)=g(y)+g(x^2)-g(0) $

Now, let $ h(x)=g(x)-g(0) $ then we get $ h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y) $ $ \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R} $  immediately.

$ P(x,0) \Rightarrow h(x) \ge -g(0) $ $ \forall x \ge f(0) $, which means $ h(x) $ is a solution of Cauchy equation with a lower bound on some non empty open interval.

Therefore, $ h(x)=cx $ where $ c $ is a constant $ \rightarrow g(x)=cx+d $

	Alternatively, we know that $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = (2x+h)g(h)$. Taking the limit when $h \rightarrow 0 $ on the right, we see that we obtain $2x\cdot g(0)$. So, $f$ must be differentiable (as we just proved that the limit of the incremental quotients exists), with $f'(x)=2cx$, for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$. It follows that $f(x) = cx^2 + c'$ and, thus, that $g(x)\equiv c$.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/212043}{Mikasa}]
	Lets us denote the given statement by $P(x,y)$. Then,
$P(1,y)\Rightarrow 2f(f(y)+1)=0\Rightarrow f(f(y)+1)=0$.
$P(x,f(y)+1)\Rightarrow f(x)+f(2-x)=0\Rightarrow f(2-x)=-f(x)$.
So we rewrite $P(x,y)$ as $f(x+f(y))-f(x-f(y))=y(x-1)f(y)$ since $f(2+f(y)-x)=f(2-(x-f(y)))=-f(x-f(y))$.
Also, $f(1)=f(2-1)=-f(1)\Rightarrow f(1)=0$. Now,
$P(x,2-y)\Rightarrow f(x+f(2-y))+f(2+f(2-y)-x)=(2-y)(x-1)f(2-y)$
$\Rightarrow f(x-f(y))+f(2-x-f(y))=-(2-y)(x-1)f(y)$
$\Rightarrow f(x-f(y))-f(x+f(y))=(y-2)(x-1)f(y)$. 
Now adding the respective expressions for $P(x,y)$ and $P(x,2-y)$ we get,
$2(y-1)(x-1)f(y)=0$. Take $x\neq 1$ then $(y-1)f(y)=0$ so $f(y)=0\forall y\neq 1$. We also know that $f(1)=0$. So the solution is $f(x)=0\forall x\in \mathbb{R}$.

Without any precision, I suppose that domain of functional equation is also $(1,+\infty)$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x)-f(y)=(y-x)f(xy)$

Let $1<a<b$
Let $x\in(\frac ba,ab)$

$P(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}a,\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}a)-f(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b)=(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b-\frac{\sqrt{abx}}a)f(x)$

$P(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b,\frac{\sqrt{abx}}x)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b)-f(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}x)=(\frac{\sqrt{abx}}x-\frac{\sqrt{abx}}b)f(a)$

Adding these three lines, we get $f(x)=\frac{af(a)-bf(b)}{a-b}+\frac{ab(f(b)-f(a))}{(a-b)x}$

$\boxed{\text{S1: }f(x)=0\text{ }\forall x\ne 0}$ is a solution. So let us from now look for non allzero solutions.

Let $u\ne 0$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$
Let $a=f(1)$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(y)-f(x)=f(y)f(\frac x{x-y})$

If $\exists x\notin\{0,u\}$ such that $f(x)=0$, then $P(u,x)$ $\implies$ $f(u)=0$, impossible. So $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$
Let then :
 $g(x)$ from $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$ defined as $g(x)=\frac{a}{f(x)}$
 $h(x)$ from $\mathbb R\setminus\{0,1\}\to\mathbb R$ defined as $h(x)=1-f(\frac x{x-1})$

Let $x,y\notin\{0,1\}$ :
$P(y,1)$ $\implies$ $f(y)=f(1)h(y)$
$P(xy,x)$ $\implies$ $f(xy)=f(x)h(y)$
And so $f(xy)=\frac 1{a}f(x)f(y)$, still true when $x=1$ or $y=1$

So $g(xy)=g(x)g(y)$ $\forall x,y\ne 0$ and $g(1)=1$ and so $g(x)$ is a nonzero multiplicative function

Using this, $P(x,y)$ may be written as new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(x-y)=\frac 1ag(x)-\frac 1ag(y)$ $\forall x\ne y\notin\{0\}$

Let $x\ne 0$ and $y\notin\{0,-x\}$
$Q(x+y,y)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=\frac 1ag(x+y)-\frac 1ag(y)$
$Q(y,x+y)$ $\implies$ $g(-x)=\frac 1ag(y)-\frac 1ag(x+y)$
Adding these two lines, we get $g(-x)=-g(x)$ $\forall x\ne 0$

Let then $x,y$ such that $x,y,x+y\ne 0$ and $z\notin\{0,-x,-y,-x-y\}$
$Q(x+y+z,y+z)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=\frac 1ag(x+y+z)-\frac 1ag(y+z)$
$Q(y+z,z)$ $\implies$ $g(y)=\frac 1ag(y+z)-\frac 1ag(z)$
$Q(x+y+z,z)$ $\implies$ $g(x+y)=\frac 1ag(x+y+z)-\frac 1ag(z)$
Adding the two first lines and subtracting the third, we get $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ $\forall x,y$ such that $x,y,x+y\notin\{0\}$
As a consequence, $f(1)=1$

It's then immediate to extend $g(x)$ to $\mathbb R$ with $g(0)=0$ and we get a non allzero additive and multiplicative function with classical result $g(x)=x$

And so $\boxed{\text{S2: }f(x)=\frac 1x\text{ }\forall x\ne 0}$

It's immediate to get that $f(x)$ is injective and so, since continuous, strictly monotonous.

Continuity and functional equation imply also that $f(x)$ can be neither upper bounded, neither lower bounded and so is surjective, so bijective.

Easy induction implies then $a_n(x)=f^{n+1}(x)-f^{n}(x)=\frac{f(f(x))+f(x)-2x}3+(-2)^n\frac{-f(f(x))+2f(x)-x}3$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$ (using bijectivity for $n<0$)

1) if $f(x)$ is increasing
Let then $x$ such that $f(x)\ne x$ so that $a_n(x)\ne 0$ $\forall n\ge 0$. Then $\frac{a_{n+1}(x)}{a_n(x)}>0$ and so $f(f(x))=2f(x)-x$ (else setting $n\to +\infty$ leads to $\frac{a_{n+1}(x)}{a_n(x)}\to -2<0$)

So we got $f(f(x))=2f(x)-x$ $\forall x$ (even $x$ such that $f(x)=x$) which is quite classical (see for example http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=2721097#p2721097 subcase 7.3.2) with solution $\boxed{f(x)=x+a}$ which indeed is a solution whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

2) If $f(x)$ is decreasing
Same mechanism as above but using $n\to -\infty$ instead of $n\to +\infty$ implies $f(f(x))=-f(x)+2x$ $\forall x$ which is also quite classical (see again for example http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=2721097#p2721097 subcase 7.1.2) with solution $\boxed{f(x)=a-2x}$ which indeed is a solution whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

Setting $x=y=0$, we get $f(0)=0$

From $f((n+2)x)+f(nx)=2f((n+1)x)+2f(x)$, easy induction gives $f(nx)=n^2f(x)$

\[f(x)=x^2g(x)\]
\[\implies f(x+y)+f(x-y)=(x+y)^2g(x+y)+(x-y)^2g(x-y)\]
\[=2f(x)+2f(y)=2x^2g(x)+2y^2g(y).\] 

Then $P(x,x)$ tells us $4x^2g(2x)=4x^2g(x)$, thus $g(2x)=g(x)$ for all rational $x$ (including, obviously, $x=0$). As such $g$ is a constant. Checking $f(x)=cx^2$ confirms that it is indeed a solution. Thus our solution set is $f(x)=cx^2$ for all rational constants $c$.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x+y))=f(x+y)+f(x)f(y)-xy$
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is not a solution. So let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$
Let $a=f(0)$

$P(a,-a)$ $\implies$ $f(a)=a^2+a+f(a)f(-a)$
Subtracting, we get $f(a)f(-a)=0$ and so $\exists v$ such that $f(v)=0$

$P(v,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$

$P(x+u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+u))=f(x+u)$
$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+u))=f(x+u)+f(x)f(u)-ux$
Subtracting, and since $f(u)\ne 0$, we get $f(x)=cx$ $\forall x$, where $c=\frac u{f(u)}$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xg(y))+g(yf(x))=2f(x)+2xy-2x$
$g(x)=c$ constant is never a solution and so $g(x)$ is not constant.
Let $a=f(0)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $g(0)=a$
$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $g(ax)=a$ and so $a=0$ since $g(x)$ is not constant.

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$

Then $P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=x$

And so $\boxed{(f,g)=(Id,Id)}$ which indeed is a solution.

And I did not use the injectivity since I first proved that $g(x)$ is not constant (I could have skipped this step using injectivity).

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy+f(x))=f(x)f(y)+x$

If $f(0)\ne 0$, $P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=\frac{f(f(0)}{f(0)}$ constant, which is never a solution. So $f(0)=0$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=x$ and so $f(x)$ is bijective and involutive.

$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(1)+1)=f(1)^2+1$
$P(f(1),1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(1)+1)=2f(1)$
Subtracting, we get $f(1)=1$

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$

Let $x\ne 0$ :
$P(x,\frac{y-f(x)}x)$ $\implies$ $f(y)=f(x)f(\frac{y-f(x)}x)+x$
$P(x,1+\frac{y-f(x)}x)$ $\implies$ $f(x+y)=f(x)f(\frac{y-f(x)}x)+x+f(x)$
Subtracting, we get $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ $\forall x\ne 0$, $\forall y$, still true when $x=0$

So $f(xy+f(x))=f(xy)+f(f(x))=f(xy)+x$
Comparing with $P(x,y)$, we get $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$

So $f(x)$ is bijective, additive and multiplicative and it's immediate to get $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

i) $ P(0,y) \implies f(c)=cf(y) $ and $ P(0,0) \implies f(c)=c^2 $.Hence $ f(0)=c=0 $ ( since $ f \neq const $.
ii) $ P(x,0) \implies f(f(x))=x (*) \implies f $ is bijective.
iii) $ P(x,1) \implies f(x+f(x))=f(x)a+x $
iv)  $ P(f(x),1) \implies f(f(x)+x)=xa+f(x) $ ( i use here $ (*) $ ).So that from iii and iv $ (f(x)-x)(a-1) $.If $ f(x)=x $ ,then we are done.Let $ a=1 $.Thus 
$ P(x,1) \implies f(x+f(x))=f(x)+x $ and since $ f $ bijective, we get $ f(x)=x $ is only solution.DONE !

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x\in A$ and so $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x>a_0$

If $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x>a_n$ for some $a_n>0$, then :
Let $x>a_n\frac{a+1}{a+2}$ : $P(\frac x{a+1},a+1)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac x{a+1}f(a+1))=f(x)+\frac x{a+1}$
But $f(a+1)=a+2$ and so $f(\frac x{a+1}f(a+1))=f(x\frac{a+2}{a+1})$ and since $x\frac{a+2}{a+1}>a_n$, this is $x\frac{a+2}{a+1}+1$

So $f(x)+\frac x{a+1}=x\frac{a+2}{a+1}+1$ and so $f(x)=x+1$

So $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x>a_n$ implies $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x>a_{n+1}=a_n\frac{a+1}{a+2}$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=x+1}$ $\forall x>0$, which indeed is a solution.

Note that monotinicy implies existence and unicity of a right limit at each point. Let $a=\lim_{x\to 0^+}f(x)$
Note that monotinicy implies existence and unicity of a left limit at each point. Let $b=\lim_{x\to 0^-}f(x)$

$f(x)-2x=f(\frac 34x)-2\frac 34x$ and so $f(x)-2x=f((\frac 34)^nx)-2(\frac 34)^nx$

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	Clearly $f$ is non-decreasing, since $f(4)-f(3) = 2$ dictates the monotony. The equation may be written as $f(4x) - 8x = f(3x) - 6x$. Consider the function $g$ given by $g(x) = f(x)-2x$; the equation writes now $g(4x) = g(3x)$, or $g(x) = g\left (\dfrac {3}{4} x\right )$. Iterating, that gives $g(x) = g\left (\left (\dfrac {3}{4}\right )^n x\right )$ for any positive integer $n$.

Since $f$ is non-decreasing, it means $\alpha = \inf \{f(x) \mid x>0\} \geq f(0)$ does exist. Then  $g(x) =\lim_{n\to \infty} g\left (\left (\dfrac {3}{4}\right )^n x\right ) = \alpha$ for $x>0$. Similarly, using  $\beta = \sup \{f(x) \mid x<0\} \leq f(0)$, we get $g(x) = \beta$. Thus $f$ is made of two linear branches, and some value $f(0) \in [\beta, \alpha]$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}find all function $ f: R\rightarrow\mathbb{R} $ sastisfying 
$ f(x+f(xy))=f(x)+xf(y) $\end{tcolorbox}
$\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(xy))=f(x)+xf(y)$
Let $t$ such that $f(t)\ne 0$. If $t=0$, $P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(0))=f(0)\ne 0$, so choosing $t=f(0)$ instead, we can WLOG consider $t\ne 0$

If $f(u)=0$ for some $u$, then $P(\frac ut,t)$ $\implies$ $u=0$
$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(1)-1)=0$ $\implies$ $f(1)=1$ and $f(0)=0$

Let $A=\{x$ such that $f(x)=x\}$. Note that $0\in A$ and $1\in A$

\begin{bolded}Rule R1\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a\in A$, then $P(1,a)$ $\implies$ $a+1\in A$

\begin{bolded}Rule R2\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : If $a\in A,a\ne 0$, then $P(a,\frac 1a)$ $\implies$ $\frac 1a\in A$

If $a\in A,a\ne 1$, then :
$P(a-1,\frac 1{a-1})$ $\implies$ $a=f(a-1)+(a-1)f(\frac 1{a-1})$ $\implies$ $\frac{f(a-1)}{a-1}+f(\frac 1{a-1})=\frac a{a-1}$
$P(\frac 1{a-1},a-1)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac a{a-1})=f(\frac 1{a-1})+\frac {f(a-1)}{a-1}$ $=\frac a{a-1}$ (see previous line)
Hence \begin{bolded}Rule R3\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : if $a\in A,a\ne 1$, then : $\frac a{a-1}\in A$

If $a\in A,a\ne 0, a\ne -1$ : R1 then R2 then R3 then R2 implies $-a\in A$, still true if $a=0$ or $a=-1$
Hence \begin{bolded}Rule R4\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : if $a\in A$; then $-a\in A$.Note that this implies $-1\in A$

If $a\in A,a\ne 0, a\ne 1$ : R2 then R3 then R2 then R4 implies $a-1\in A$, still true if $a=0$ or $a=1$
Hence \begin{bolded}Rule R5\end{underlined}\end{bolded} : if $a\in A$; then $a-1\in A$.

If $f(u)=1$ for some $u$, then $P(u,1)$ $\implies$ $f(u+1)=u+1$ $\implies$ (Rule R5) $f(u)=u$ $\implies$ $u=1$

If $f(u)=f(v)=0$ for some $u,v$, we already got $u=v=0$
If $f(u)=f(v)=c\ne 0$, we know that $u,v\ne 0$. Then :
$P(v,\frac uv)$ $\implies$ $f(v+c)=c+vf(\frac uv)$
$P(v,1)$ $\implies$ $f(v+c)=c+v$
Subtracting, we get $f(\frac uv)=1$ and so $\frac uv=1$ and so $u=v$
So $f(x)$ is injective.

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(1+f(x))=1+f(x)$ $\implies$ (rule R5) $f(f(x))=f(x)$ $\implies$ (injectivity) $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

a) $ f(f(m)+ f(n)) = f(f(m))+ f(n) $ 
b) $ f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4 $\end{tcolorbox}
Due to $f(f(m))$ in RHS, we get that $f(x)$ is from $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$
Using (a) with $(1,n)$ and then with $(n,1)$, we get $f(f(n))=f(n)+2$ and so $f(f(m)+f(n))=f(m)+f(n)+2$
Simple induction then implies $f(2n)=2n+2$

So, since injective, for $n$ odd $>1$, we need $f(n)=2p+1$ odd and induction gives $f(2n+1)=2n+3$ $\forall n\ge p$

Considering then the smallest odd integer $k$ such that $f(k)=k+2$, we get with injectivity $k=3$ (else $f(3)$ must be $k$, so $k\ge 7$ and no possible value for $f(5)$)

Hence the unique solution :

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(2f(x)+f(y))=2x+y$
$P(x,y)$ immediately shows that $f(x)$ is a bijection.
Let $u$ such that $f(u)=0$

$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(x))=2x+u$
$P(u,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(y))=y+2u$
So $P(x,y)$ becomes $f(2f(x)+f(y))=f(2f(x))+f(f(y))-3u$ and surjectivity gives $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)-3u$

So $f(x)=ax+b$ (since in $\mathbb Q$) and, plugging back in equation, we get $b=0$ and $a=\pm 1$

Hence two solutons :
$f(x)=x$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Q$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(2f(x)+f(y))=2x+y$
$f(x)$ is bijective.

$P(x,2)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(x)+f(2))=2x+2$
$P(1,2x)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(1)+f(2x))=2+2x$
And so (subtracting and using injectivity) : $2f(x)=f(2x)+c$ where $c=2f(1)-f(2)$

So $P(\frac x2,y)$ becomes $Q(x,y)$ : $f(f(x)+f(y)+c)=x+y$

$Q(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)+f(1)+c)=x+1$
$Q(1,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(1)+f(y)+c)=1+y$
So $f(f(x)+f(y)+c)=f(f(x)+f(1)+c)+f(f(y)+f(1)+c)-2$

Let $g(x)=f(x+c+2f(1))-2$ and this becomes $g(f(x)+f(y)-2f(1))=g(f(x)-f(1))+g(f(y)-f(1))$
Surjectivity of $f(x)$ implies then $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ $\forall x,y\ge -f(1)$ and, since lowerbounded, $g(x)=kx$ for some $k$

So $f(x)=ux+v$ for some $u,v$ and plugging this back in original equation, we get $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x>0$, which indeed is a solution

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$:
\[ f(x^2)+f(xy)=f(x)f(y)+yf(x)+xf(x+y) \]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^2)+f(xy)=f(x)f(y)+yf(x)+xf(x+y)$

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(0)(f(x)+x-2)=0$
If $f(0)\ne 0$, this gives $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=2-x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.
If $f(0)=0$, then :

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=xf(x)$ and so $f(-x)=-f(x)$
$P(x,-x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)(f(x)+x)=0$ and so $\forall x$, either $f(x)=0$; either $f(x)=-x$

Suppose then $\exists u,v\ne 0$ such that $f(u)=0$ and $f(v)=-v$

$P(u,v)$ $\implies$ $f(uv)=uf(u+v)$ and so $f(uv)=f(u+v)=0$ (no other possibilities)
$P(v,u)$ $\implies$ $-v^2+f(uv)=-uv+vf(u+v)$ and so $u=v$, impossible

Hence the only possibilities :
$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

$\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=-x}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

	Let $a$ and $b$ be any positive real numbers. 

* $x = y = a$ shows that $f(2a+f(a)) = 2a+f(a)$
* $x = 2a+f(a)$ and $y = b$ shows that $4a+2f(a)+f(b) = f(2a+f(a)+b+f(x)) = f(4a+2f(a)+b)$
* $x = a$ and $y = 3a+b+f(a)$ shows that $f(4a+2f(a)+b) = 2a+f(3a+b+f(a))$
* $x = a$ and $y = 2a+b$ shows that $f(3a+b+f(a)) = 2a+f(2a+b)$.

So: $2f(a)+f(b) = f(2a+b)$. Now let $s$ and $t$ be any positive real numbers. 

* $a = s+t$ and $b = t$ shows that $2f(s+t)+f(t) = f(2s+3t)$
* $a = s$ and $b = 3t$ shows that $f(2s+3t) = 2f(s)+f(3t)$
* $a = b = t$ shows that $f(3t) = 3f(t)$

So $f(s+t) = f(s)+f(t)$ for all positive real numbers. Since the image of $f$ is contained in $\mathbb{R}^+$, it is a classical result that the only solutions of this functional equation are scalar functions $f_a:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}^+:x\mapsto ax$ with $a>0$. Plugging these functions into the original equation shows that only $f_1 = \text{id}$ is the only solution.

Adding fonctional equations for $n\in\{2,3,..,f(8)-1\}$, we get : $\sum_{n=2}^{f(8)-1}f(f(n-1))=f(f(8))-f(2)$
But, since $f(8)\ge 10$, one of the $f(f(n-1))$ in LHS is $f(f(8))$ and so $LHS>f(f(8))>RHS$, impossible.

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f^2(1+f(x))=1+2f(x)+x^2$
$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f^2(x+u)=x^2+2f(x)+1$

____________________________________________


At first we guess only solutions are $f(x)=0$ or $f(x)=x$. Note that the equation looks like Cauchy equation, so we may prove $f$ is a Cauchy equation, and then show that $f(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}) \subset \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ which will suffice .Now one want some thing like $af(a)=f(a^2)$ to do this. We begin investigating the equation  a little. We substitute $a=c=0$ to get $f(f(b))=f(b)$.Now substituting $a=x\quad ;b=x^2 \quad ; c=-x^2$ in the original equation and using the latter equation we get; \[ f(x^2)=xf(x)+f(0)\] from which if we let $x=1$ we get $f(0)=0$. We get then \[f(x^2) = xf(x) \qquad (1)\] Now using this in the original equation we with $a=x \quad;b=0 \quad $ we get \[f(x^2 + c) = f(x^2) + f(c)\], one can now deduce from it the identity $f(x)=-f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$, whence we can prove $f$ is Cauchy function. 

We have now \begin{bolded}an equivalent problem\end{bolded} of finding all Cauchy functions $f$ such that \[f(a^2) = a f(a)  \ \ \ \forall a \in \mathbb{R} \ \ \ (2) \]
\[ f(f(b)) = f(b) \ \ \ \forall b\in \mathbb{R} \ \ \ (3)\]
______
But then we note that \[f(zf(z))=f(z^2) \ \ \ (4)\], so we have letting $a=s+t$ in this latter equation and using the Cauchy condition; \[f(s^2) + 2 f(st) + f(t^2) = f(sf(s)) + f(sf(t)) + f(tf(s)) + f(tf(t))\], using $(4)$ again but with $z=s$ once and $z=t$ another. We get \[f(st)= \frac{f(sf(t))+f(tf(s))}{2} \ \ \ (5) \] Now substituting $t=f(s)$ in the $(5)$ we get; \[f(s^2) = f(sf(s)) = f(f(s)^2) = f(f(s)f(s)) = f(s)^2\] where in the last equality we have used $(2)$ which is the required. So we have $f(x) = f(1) x$ , but substituting that result in (3) say we get $f(1)=0,1$[\/hide]

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f((x+y)f(x))=xf(x)+xf(y)$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)=v\ne 0$
If $f(0)\ne 0$, then $P(0,\frac u{f(0)})$ $\implies$ $f(u)=0$, impossible. So $f(0)=0$

$P(x,-x)$ $\implies$ $f(-x)=-f(x)$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$ and so $f(x)$ is odd.

(a) : $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=xf(x)$
(b) : $P(-x,2x)$ $\implies$ $-f(xf(x))=xf(x)-xf(2x)$
(c) : $P(x,y-x)$ $\implies$ $f(yf(x))=xf(x)-xf(x-y)$
(d) : $P(-x,x+y)$ $\implies$ $-f(yf(x))=xf(x)-xf(x+y)$
(a)+(b)-(c)-(d) implies $f(2x)=f(x+y)+f(x-y)$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$
So $f(x)$ is additive

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=xf(x)$
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))+f(yf(x))=xf(x)+xf(y)$
Subtracting, we get new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(yf(x))=xf(y)$

So $f(f(yf(u)))=f(uf(y))=yf(u)$ and so $f(f(x))=x$ $\forall x$ and $f(x)$ is bijective

$Q(f(x),y)$ becomes $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ and $f(x)$ is multiplicative

Additive, multiplicative and bijective implies classicaly $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x\text{   }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution.

   (1) f:N->N 
   (2) f(n) = f(n+f(n))

(a) if the range of f(n) is finite, prove that f(n) is periodic.
(b) Example f(n) which is not periodic.\end{tcolorbox}
a) Easy induction gives $f(n)=f(n+kf(n))$ $\forall k,n\in\mathbb N$
If $|f(\mathbb N)|$ is finite, then this implies $f(n+\text{lcm}(f(\mathbb N)))=f(n)$ and $f(n)$ is indeed periodic.

b) Choose for example $f(n)=10^{g(n)}$ where $g(n)$ is the rank from the right (beginning at $1$) of the rightmost digit $0$ in the decimal representation (beginning with a leading zero) of $n$.
Examples :
$n=103$ $\implies$ $g(n)=2$ $\implies$ $f(n)=100$ $\implies$ $n+f(n)=203$ and $f(n+f(n))=100$
$n=1010$ $\implies$ $g(n)=1$ $\implies$ $f(n)=10$ $\implies$ $n+f(n)=1020$ and $f(n+f(n))=10$
$n=12$ $\implies$ $g(n)=3$ $\implies$ $f(n)=1000$ $\implies$ $n+f(n)=1012$ and $f(n+f(n))=1000$
It's easy to see that $f(n)$ fits the requirements and is unbounded, so non periodic.

It's from "IMO" 1980, Problem 1.
You can prove $f(x)=x+1$ for any rational $x$ without any other constraints.
If you add something like continuity you will get that $f(x)=x+1$ for every real number (if you assume $f$ to be from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$)
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	Continuity for a function from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ makes perfect sense, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is endowed with the subspace topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{Q}} = \{U \cap \mathbb{Q}\mid U \textrm{ open in } \mathbb{R}\}$ (it may not be needed in the problem, but that's a different issue).
It's the continuity for a function defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ that makes little sense, since the subspace topology $\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{Z}} = \{U \cap \mathbb{Z}\mid U \textrm{ open in } \mathbb{R}\}$ is the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Z}$, so every function is continuous.

Sorry, but I prefer to forget continuity property (I dis not understood Mavropnevma's precision)
I forget also the precision "for all real value" which seems senseless for a function from $\mathbb q\to\mathbb Q$

Then ;
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)-f(x+y)+1$
Let $a=f(1)-1$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=1$
$P(0,1)$ $\implies$ $f(1)=a+1$
$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2)=a^2+a+1$
$P(2,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=a^3+a^2+a+1$
$P(3,1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1$
$P(2,2)$ $\implies$ $a^4=a^2$ and so $a\in\{-1,0,1\}$

1) Case where $a=0$
$P(x-1,1)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=1\text{  }\forall x\in\mathbb Q}$ which indeed is a solution.

2) Case where $a=1$
$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ and so $f(x+n)=f(x)+n$ and $f(n)=n+1$
$P(x,n)$ $\implies$ $f(nx)-1=n(f(x)-1)$ and so $f(\frac pq)=\frac pq+1$
And so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x+1\text{  }\forall x\in\mathbb Q}$ which indeed is a solution.

3) Case where $a=-1$
$P(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=1-f(x)$ and so $f(x+2)=f(x)$ and so $f(2)=1$
$P(\frac 12,2)$ $\implies$ $f(1)=1$, impossible. And so no solution in this case.

I dont know if the two solutions are considered as continuous from $\mathbb Q\to\mathbb Q$

Yes, they do :) As for $\mathbb{R}$, all "elementary" functions are continuous when restricted at $\mathbb{Q}$, since the restriction of a continuous function to a subspace stays continuous. A counterexample is Dirichlet's function, not continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, but constant - thus continuous, on $\mathbb{Q}$.

$ f(x+y) \cdot ( f(x)+f(y)) = f(x \cdot y) $

for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R^*}$ with $x+y \ne 0$.\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))=f(xy)$
Let $a=f(1)$

$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2)=\frac 12$
$P(2,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=\frac 1{2a+1}$
$P(3,1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=\frac 1{2a^2+a+1}$
$P(4,1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=\frac 1{2a^3+a^2+a+1}$
$P(5,1)$ $\implies$ $f(6)=\frac 1{2a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1}$
$P(2,3)$ $\implies$ $(2a-1)(a-1)(a+1)(2a^2+a+1)=0$ and so $a\in\left\{-1,\frac 12,+1\right\}$

If $a=\frac 12$, we get $f(1)=f(2)$, impossible since injective.
If $a=-1$, we get $f(1)=f(3)$, impossible since injective.
So $a=1$ and $f(n)=\frac 1n$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$

Let $x>0$, a simple induction using $P(x+n,1)$ implies $f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1}$ and then $P(x,n)$ $\implies$ $f(nx)=\frac{f(x)}n$

Let $x,y>0$
$P(3x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(3x+y)(f(x)+3f(y))=f(xy)$
$P(2x,x+y)$ $\implies$ $f(3x+y)(f(x)+2f(x+y))=f(x(x+y))$
Dividing these two lines, we get $\frac{f(xy)}{f(x(x+y))}=\frac{f(x)+3f(y)}{f(x)+2f(x+y)}$

$P(2x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(2x+y)(f(x)+2f(y))=f(xy)$
$P(x,x+y)$ $\implies$ $f(2x+y)(f(x)+f(x+y))=f(x(x+y))$
Dividing these two lines, we get $\frac{f(xy)}{f(x(x+y))}=\frac{f(x)+2f(y)}{f(x)+f(x+y)}$

So $\frac{f(x)+3f(y)}{f(x)+2f(x+y)}$ $=\frac{f(x)+2f(y)}{f(x)+f(x+y)}$ and so $\frac 1{f(x+y)}=\frac 1{f(x)}+\frac 1{f(y)}$

Plugging this in original equation, we get $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$ and so $\frac 1{f(x)}$ over $\mathbb R^+$ is injective, additive and multiplicative.
We immediately get $f(x)=\frac 1x$ $\forall x>0$

And extension to $R^-$ is very easy, giving the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=\frac 1x}$ $\forall x\ne 0$

I suppose you mean $f(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to[0,+\infty)$
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^2+y^2)=f(x^2-y^2)+f(2xy)$
$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$
$P(0,\sqrt{|x|})$ $\implies$ $f(x)=f(-x)$

Let $g(x)$ from $[0,+\infty)\to[0,+\infty)$ defined as $g(x)=f(\sqrt x)$. $g(x)$ is continuous.

Let $x,y\ge 0$. $P(\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{x+y}+\sqrt x}2},\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{x+y}-\sqrt x}2)}$ $\implies$ $f(\sqrt{x+y})=f(\sqrt x)+f(\sqrt y)$

And so $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$ and continuity implies $g(x)=ax$ and $\boxed{f(x)=ax^2}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\ge 0$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+yf(x))=f(x)+xf(y)$
Let $a=f(1)$
$f(x)$ is obviously strictly increasing and so injective.

If $a<1$, then $P(1,\frac 1{1-a})$ $\implies$ $a=0$, impossible. and so $a\ge 1$
$P(1,\frac{n-1}a)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac{n-1}a)=f(n)-a$
$a\ge 1$ $\implies$  $\frac{n-1}a\le n-1$ and so $f(n)-a=f(\frac{n-1}a)\le f(n-1)$ and so $f(n)\le f(n-1)+a$ $\implies$ $f(n)\le na$

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(ax+1)=f(x)+a$
$P(1,ax+1)$ $\implies$ $f(a^2x+a+1)=f(x)+2a$
And simple induction gives $f(a^nx+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^k)=f(x)+na$

Setting $x=n$ in above equation, we get $f(a^nn+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^k)=f(n)+na$
But $P(n,1)$ $\implies$ $f(n+f(n))=f(n)+na$ and so, since injective, $f(n)=(a^n-1)n+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^k$

Then $f(n)\le na$ $\implies$ $(a^n-1)n+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^k\le na$ and so $a=1$ and $f(n)=n$

$P(q,\frac pq)$ $\implies$ $f(p+q)=q+qf(\frac pq)$ and so $f(\frac pq)=\frac pq$

And so, since strictly increasing, we get $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x>0$, which indeed is a solution

$P(\frac x2,\frac 12)$ $\implies$ $f(\frac x4)=\frac{x^2}2f(x)+\frac {ax}4+\frac a2$
And so, equating these two expressions for $f(\frac x4)$, we get $xf(x)+\frac a4=\frac{x^2}2f(x)+\frac {ax}4+\frac a2$

And so $f(x)=\frac{a(x+1)}{2x(2-x)}$

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $a=0$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/212018}{Tintarn}]
	I have a solution if we are accepting $0$ to be in the domain of $f$.

Let $P(a,b)$ be the condition that $f(f(a)^2+2f(b)^2) = a^2+2b^2$
$P(a,0)$ directly yields that $f$ is injective.
Obviously there exist integers $x$ and $y$ with $f(x)=0, f(y)=1$.
$P(1,1)$ yields $f(3y^2)=3$.
$P(0,1)$ yields $f(9x^4+2(y^2+2x^2)^2)=2$.
Now, comparing $P(3y^2,x)$ and $P(y,9x^4+2(y^2+2x^2)^2)$ we get
\[9y^4+2x^2=f(9)=y^2+2(9x^4+2(y^2+2x^2)^2)^2\]
and thus $9y^4 \ge 8y^8$ and hence $y=0$ or $y=1$. If $y=0$, then $1=f(y)=f(0)=f(3y^2)=3$. Absurd!
Hence $y=1$ and $x^2+4=(9x^2+2(1+2x^2)^2)^2 \ge 64x^8$ and thus $x=0$.
Now, $f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=$ by the results from above.
From now on, it's easy to prove $that f(n)=n$ holds for every $n$ inductively using the identities $(2n+1)^2+2(n-1)^2=(2n-1)^2+2(n+1)^2$ and $(2n+2)^2+2(2n-2)^2=(2n-2)^2+2(2n)^2$.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)^2+2f(y)^2)=x^2+2y^2$
$f(x)$ is injective.
Let $a_n=f(n)^2$

Subtracting $P(n+4,n+1)$ from $P(n,n+3)$ and using injectivity, we get  $a_{n+4}=2a_{n+3}-2a_{n+1}+a_n$

Since characteristic equation is $x^4-2x^3+2x-1=(x-1)^3(x+1)$, this is easily solved as $a_n=an^2+bn+c+d(-1)^n$ 
and so $f(n)=\sqrt{an^2+bn+c+d(-1)^n}$

Plugging this in original equation, we easily get $(a,b,c,d)=(1,0,0,0)$ and so the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb N$

Simple inductions.
This is true for $n=0$

Induction 1 :
If $f(x+nf(y))=f(x)-ny$ for some $n\ge 0$, then $f(x+(n+1)f(y))$ $=f((x+nf(y))+f(y))=f(x+nf(y))-y$ $=(f(x)-ny)-y=f(x)-(n+1)y$
Hence $f(x+nf(y))=f(x)-ny$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$

Induction 2:
If $f(x+nf(y))=f(x)-ny$ for some $n\le 0$, then $f(x)-ny=f(x+nf(y))=f((x+(n-1)f(y))+f(y))$ $=f(x+(n-1)f(y))-y$ and so $f(x+(n-1)f(y))=f(x)-(n-1)y$
Hence $f(x+nf(y))=f(x)-ny$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z_{\le 0}$

	A (bad) joke. The expression $X=x^3+x-2$ is irrelevant, as long as its range is the whole $\mathbb{R}$. It follows that $f(0)=0$, $f(y)=f(y^3)$, $f(X+y) = f(X)+f(y)$, so $2f(X) = f(2X) = f(8X^3) = 8f(X^3) = 8f(X)$, whence $f(X)=0$ for all real $X$.

	Can anyone explain the above solution ?
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/89198}{chaotic_iak}]
	It is clear enough.

Let $X = x^3+x-2$, then the range of $X$ is $\mathbb{R}$ and thus $f(X+y) = f(X) + f(y^3)$ for all $X,y \in \mathbb{R}$. Call that statement $P(X,y)$. Then,
$P(0,0) \implies f(0) = 0$
$P(0,y) \implies f(y) = f(y^3)$, and so $P(X,y)$ becomes $f(X+y) = f(X) + f(y)$.
$P(X,X) \implies f(2X) = f(X) + f(X) = 2f(X)$.
Also, $f(2X) = f((2X)^3) = f(8X^3)$, and due to $f(X+y) = f(X) + f(y)$, we have $f(nx) = nf(x)$ for any integer $n$ (well-known result), so $f(8X^3) = 8f(X^3) = 8f(X)$. Thus $2f(X) = f(2X) = f(8X^3) = 8f(X)$, so $f(X) = 0$ for all $X$ which is a solution.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(x)+2f(y))=f(2x)+f(2y)$

If $f(x)<x$ for some $x>0$, let $y$ such that $f(y)=\frac{x-f(x)}2$. Then $P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(2y)=0$, impossible.
So $f(x)\ge x$ $\forall x>0$

If $f(a)=f(b)=c$ for some $a,b,c>0$,then :
Comparaison of $P(1,a)$ and $P(1,b)$ implies $f(2a)=f(2b)$
Comparaison of $P(a,x)$ and $P(b,x)$ implies then $f(a+c+2f(x))=f(b+c+2f(x))$ $\forall x>0$
Surjectivity implies then $f(x+a)=f(x+b)$ $\forall x>c$
If $a\ne b$, this implies that $f(x)$ is periodic from a given point, in contradiction with $f(x)\ge x$ $\forall x>0$
So $f(x)$ is injective

Then, comparaison of $P(x,1)$ with $P(1,x)$ implies $f(x+f(x)+2f(1))=f(1+f(1)+2f(x))$ and injectivity implies $f(x)=x+(f(1)-1)$

Plugging this back in original equation, we get $f(1)=1$ and so the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x>0$

If $g(0)\ne 0$, $P(0,x,0)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=x^2+c$ where $c=\frac{g(g(0))}{g(0)}-g(0)$ which unfortunately is never a solution, whatever is $c\in\mathbb R$
So $g(0)=0$
Let then $h(x)=g(x)-x^2$

$P(0,x,y)$ $\implies$ $h(xy)=h(x)h(y)$

Subtracting $P(0,y,1)$ from $P(x,y,1)$, we get new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $h(h(x)+y)=x+h(y)$

$Q(x,0)$ $\implies$ $h(h(x))=x$
$Q(h(x),y)$ $\implies$ $h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)$

So $h(x)$ is additive, multiplicative, and involutive and it's immediate to get $h(x)=x$ $\forall x$

$P(a,x)$ $\implies$ $f(af(x))+f(f(x))=f(a)f(x)+2$
Subtracting, we get $f(f(x))=\frac{f(a)}{a+1}f(x)+\frac{f(a)}{a+1}$
$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=\frac a2f(x)+1$
Subtracting, we get $\left(\frac{f(a)}{a+1}-\frac a2\right)f(x)+\frac{f(a)}{a+1}-1=0$
So, since $f(x)$ is not constant, we get $\frac{f(a)}{a+1}-\frac a2=0$ and $\frac{f(a)}{a+1}-1=0$ and so $a=2$ and $f(a)=3$

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=f(x)+1$ and simple induction gives $f(n)=n+1$ and so, since continuous, $[1,+\infty)\subseteq f(\mathbb R^+)$
Then $f(f(x))=f(x)+1$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x+1$ $\forall x\ge 1$

Let then $x>0$ and $y>\max(1,\frac 1x-1)$ so that $f(y)=y+1$ and $f(f(y))=y+2$ and $f(xf(y))=f(xy+x)=xy+x+1$ :
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{f(x)=x+1}$ $\forall x>0$, which indeed is a solution.

No, but the proof is quite elementary.
Problem : find all functions $f(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(f(x))=f(x)$

1) Claim : A general solution is :
Let $A,B$ any two supplementary subvectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ in A and B (so that any real may be written in a unique manner as $x=a(x)+b(x)$)

Then $\boxed{f(x)=a(x)}$

2) Proof that this expression is indeed a solution
That's trivial ($a(x)$ is additive and $a(a(x))=a(x)$)

3) Proof that any solution may be written in the given form (and so we have a general\end{underlined} solution)
Let $f(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(f(x))=f(x)$
Let $A=\{x$ such that $f(x)=x\}$
Let $B=\{x$ such that $f(x)=0\}$
Since $f(x)$ is additive, $A,B$ both are subvectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $a(x)=f(x)$ : $a(x)\in A$ $\forall x$
Let $b(x)=x-f(x)$ : $b(x)\in B$ $\forall x$
$x=a(x)+b(x)$ and $A\cap B=\{0\}$ and so $A,B$ are indeed supplementary.
Q.E.D.

4) trivial examples
$(A,B)=(\mathbb R,\{0\})$ gives $f(x)=x$ $\forall x$
$(A,B)=(\{0\},\mathbb R)$ gives $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$

Is it a real olympiad problem ?
Could you kindly confirm us that you have an olympiad-level solution ?

Two doubts :
1) setting $(x,y)=(-f(0),0)$ in second equation, we immediately get $f(f(-f(0))-f(0))=0$ and so first conditon is useless since trivially obtained from the second.

2) besides the trivial $f(x)=x+a$ $\forall x$ and $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$, it is possible to build infinitely many very strange solutions and I did not succeed up to now to find a general form for all of them.

Hence my doubts about the origin of this exercise

when adding the condition i ment for the first one

Let $\mathbb N$ be the set of all positive integers.
Let $A=\{n\in\mathbb N$ such that $f(nx)=nf(x)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb N\}$ : $1\in A$

$\frac 1{2n}+\frac 1{2n}=\frac 1{n}$ $\implies$ $f(2n)=2f(n)$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$ and so $2\in A$

If $A\ne \mathbb N$, let $p$ the smallest positive integer such that $p\notin A$. $p\ge 3$
If $p=qr$ with $q,r<p$ is not prime $f(px)=f(qrx)=qf(rx)=qrf(x)$ and so contradiction. So $p$ is an odd prime.
So $p+1=2q$ for some $q<p$ and so $f((p+1)x)=f(2qx)=2f(qx)=2qf(x)=(p+1)f(x)$

Then $\frac 1{p(p+1)x}+\frac 1{(p+1)x}=\frac 1{px}$ implies $\frac 1{f(p(p+1)x)}+\frac 1{f((p+1)x)}=\frac 1{f(px)}$

$\implies$ $\frac 1{(p+1)f(px)}+\frac 1{(p+1)f(x)}=\frac 1{f(px)}$ $\implies$ $f(px)=pf(x)$ and so contradiction

So $A=\mathbb N$ and $f(nx)=nf(x)$ $\forall n,x\in\mathbb N$ and so $f(x)=xf(1)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb N$

Second equality implies $g(x+g(0))=h(x)+f(0)$
Setting $x\to x+g(0)$ in first equation, we get $f(x+f(y)+g(0))=h(x)+f(0)+h(y)$
Swapping $x$ and $y$ in the previous line gives $f(y+f(x)+g(0))=h(y)+f(0)+h(x)$
And so $f(x+f(y)+g(0))=f(y+f(x)+g(0))$ and injectivity implies $f(x)=x+a$
And so $g(x)=x+b$ and $h(x)=x+c$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)=f(x-1)f(y)+f(y-1)f(x)$
Let $a=f(1)$

If $f(-1)=1$ :
$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$
$P(-2,1)$ $\implies$ $1=af(-3)$ and so $a\ne 0$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=af(x)$ and so $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(2n)=0\text{  and  }f(2n-1)=a^n\text{  }\forall n\in\mathbb Z}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R^*$

If $f(-1)\ne 1$ and $f(0)=0$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Determine all functions $f : \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ such that \[   f(x+yf(x))=f(f(x))+xf(y)   , \ \ \  \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^+.\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+yf(x))=f(f(x))+xf(y)$

If $f(1)<1$ : $P(1,\frac 1{1-f(1)})$ $\implies$ $f(f(1))=0$, impossible. So $f(1)\ge 1$
If $f(1)>1$ : $P(1,1-\frac 1{f(1)})$ $\implies$ $f(1-\frac 1{f(1)})=0$, impossible. So $f(1)\le 1$
So $f(1)=1$

$P(1,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ and so $f(x+n)=f(x)+n$

Let $x,y>0$. Let $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $n>x-y$

$P(x,\frac{y-x+n}{f(x)})$ $\implies$  $f(y)+n=f(f(x))+xf(\frac{y-x+n}{f(x)})$
$P(x,\frac{y-x+n+f(x)}{f(x)})$ $\implies$ $f(y+f(x))+n=f(f(x))+xf(\frac{y-x+n}{f(x)})+x$
Subtracting, we get new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(y+f(x))=f(y)+x$

$Q(x,1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=x$
$Q(f(x),y)$ $\implies$ $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and since $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$, we get $f(x)=f(1)x=x$

Hence the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution.

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=n\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution, whatever is $n\in\mathbb N$ So let us from now look only for non constant solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f\left(x+\frac y{f(x)}\right)=f(\left(y+\frac 1{f(x)}\right)$
Since $f(x)$ is not constant, let $a$ such that $f(a)\ne 1$

If $f(u)=f(v)=c$ for some $u,v$, then subtracting $P(u,c(x-v))$ from $P(v,c(x-v))$, we get $f(x+u-v)=f(x)$ $\forall x$

Let $t\in\mathbb R$ : $P(a,\frac{tf(a)-af(a)+1}{1-f(a)})$ $\implies$ $f(t+\frac{tf(a)^2-af(a)^2+1}{f(a)-f(a)^2})$ $=f(\frac{tf(a)^2-af(a)^2+1}{f(a)-f(a)^2})$

And so, using property two lines above : $f(x+t)=f(x)$ $\forall x,t$, impossible since non constant.

Hence only solution is constant functions.

\end{problem}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/198008}{andreiromania}]
	We first prove that $f(x) \le 1$ for every $x$.
Consider the equation in $y$, $yf(x)=x+y \Leftrightarrow y(f(x)-1)=x$.If there exists a $x$ for which $f(x)>1$,then the equation has a solution $y_{x}>0$.We plug $x$ and $y_{x}$ in the hypothesis to obtain that $f(x)f(y_{x}f(x))=f(x)f(x+y_{x})=f(x+y_{x}) \Rightarrow f(x)=1$,obviously obtaining a contradiction.
Now we obviously have $f(x+y)=f(x)f(yf(x)) \le f(x)$ so obviously $f$ is decreasing.
We now have 3 cases to deal with.
1)There exists $c \in (0,\infty)$ so that $f(c)=1$.We obviously get that $f((0,c])={1}$.Then for $y=c$ and any $x$ we have $f(x+c)=f(x)f(cf(x)) \ge f(c)f(x)=f(x)$,but at the same time from monotony of $f$ we have $f(x+c) \le f(x)$,so we obtain $f(x+c)=f(x)$ for every x;in particular we have that $f((c,2c])=f((0,c])={1}$,so we obtain that $f(2c)=1$.Repeating the procedure ad infinitum we get the solution $f(x)=1$,a constant function.
2)$sup f=1$,but there exists no $c$ for which $f(c)=1$.This actually means that $lim_{x \to 0}(f(x))=1$.
Edit: My solution for this case was incorrect,refer to pco's solution.
3)$sup f=L<1$(Doesnt matter if this supremum is reached or not).Then we have that $f(x+y)=f(x)f(yf(x)) \le Lf(x)$ so applying this repeatedly we get that $f(x+1) \le Lf(x+\frac{n-1}{n}) \le ... \le L^{n}f(x)$ for any $n$ and any $x$,thus we get that $f(x+1)=0$ for any $x$,obviously false.So we have no solutions in this case.


NOTE:Throughout the solution I liberally used the fact that $f$ is decreasing and the fact that $f(x) \le 1$ without mentioning them again.Refer to these two facts if anything in my solution is unclear.

	\begin{tcolorbox}$f: (0; + \infty) \rightarrow (0; + \infty)$

$ x,y\in\mathbb{R}^+ $

Find all function

$f(x) \cdot f(y  f(x))=f(x+y) $\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)=f(x)f(yf(x))$

If $f(x)>1$ for some $x>0$, then $P(x,\frac x{f(x)-1})$ $\implies$ $f(x)=1$, impossible. So $f(x)\le 1$ $\forall x$
As a consequence, $f(x+y)\le f(x)$ and so $f(x)$ is non increasing.
If $f(t)=1$ for some $t>0$, then $P(t,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x+t)=f(x)$ $\forall x>0$
So, since non increasing, $f(x)$ is constant and so $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=1\text{  }\forall x>0}$, which indeed is a solution.

If $f(x)<1$ $\forall x>0$, we get that $f(x)$ is decreasing and so injective.

Let $a=\frac 1{f(1)}-1>0$ so that $f(1)=\frac 1{a+1}$

$P(1,(a+1)x+\frac 1{f((a+1)x+1)})$ $\implies$ $f(1+(a+1)x+\frac 1{f((a+1)x+1)})=f(1)f(x+\frac 1{(a+1)f((a+1)x+1)})$
$P(1+(a+1)x,\frac 1{f((a+1)x+1)})$ $\implies$ $f(1+(a+1)x+\frac 1{f((a+1)x+1)})=f(1+(a+1)x)f(1)$

Subtracting and using injectivity, we get $x+\frac 1{(a+1)f((a+1)x+1)}=1+(a+1)x$ and so $(a+1)f((a+1)x+1)=\frac 1{ax+1}$
But $P(1,(a+1)x)$ $\implies$ $f(1+(a+1)x)=f(1)f(x)=\frac{f(x)}{a+1}$

And so $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=\frac 1{ax+1}\text{  }\forall x>0}$, which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a>0$

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution, whatever is $g(x)$
So let us from now look only for non allzero $f(x)$ functions. Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

$f(ux)=g(x)f(u)+f(x)=g(u)f(x)+f(u)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=af(x)+1$ where $a=\frac{g(u)-1}{f(u)}$
Note that this implies that $g(x)$ is monotonous.

So $af(xy)+1=(af(y)+1)(af(x)+1)$ and so $g(xy)=g(x)g(y)$

This is a very classical and simple problem whose monotonous solutions are :
1) $g(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and so $f(x)=c$ constant $\implies$ $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)\equiv c\text{ and }g(x)\equiv 0}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $c\in\mathbb R^*$

2) $g(x)=1$ $\forall x$ and then $f(xy)=f(x)+f(y)$ $\implies$ $f(u\times 0)=f(u)+f(0)$ $\implies$ $f(u)=0$, impossible

3) $g(0)=0$ and $g(x)=\text{sign}(x)|x|^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha \ge 0$ and so :

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x(y+1)-f(x))=xf(y)$
Let $u$ such that $f(u)\ne 0$

$P(\frac x{f(u)},u)$ $\implies$ $f(x)$ is surjective.
Since surjective, $\exists v,w$ such that $f(v)=-u$ and $f(w)=0$
If $f(-1)=0$, $P(v,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(u)=0$, impossible. So $f(-1)\ne 0$ and $P(x,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-f(x))=xf(-1)$ and $f(x)$ is injective.

$P(x,w)$ $\implies$ $f(x(w+1)-f(x))=xf(w)=0=f(w)$ and so, since injective, $f(x)=x(w+1)-w$

	$P(x,-1)$ implies $f(-f(x))=xf(-1)$. $P(0,-1)$ shows that there is $z$ such that $f(z)=0$. Then $P(z,-1)$ implies $f(0)=zf(-1)$. So, $f(-1)=0$ or our $z$ must be unique.

First case: $f(-1)=0$. Then also $f(-f(x))=xf(-1)=0$. If $f$ is constantly zero but if there is $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \ne 0$ then by plugging in $y=x_0$ in the original equation we see that $f$ must be surjective, hence also $-f(x)$ covers all real values and therefore $f(x)=0$ for every $x$ because of $f(-f(x))=0$.

Second case: There is a unique $z$ such that $f(z)=0$.
Then $P(0,-1)$ implies $z=-f(0)$. But we know that $f(0)=zf(-1)=-f(0)f(-1)$. Thus, $f(0)=0$ or $f(-1)=-1$.
If $f(-1)=-1$ then $P(-1,0)$ implies $f(0)=0$. Thus, $f(0)=0$ holds in any case. Now, $P(x,0)$ implies $f(x-f(x))=0$ but for we know that the only point where $f$ is zero is $x=0$ we conclude that $f(x)-x=0$ and thus $f(x)=x$ for every $x$.

How do you know that? Notice that it could be $f(x)=0$ for every $x \in \mathbb{R} \ \{0\}$ and $f(0)=1$ (which is obviously not a solution) but then there would not be any such $x_0$. So how can you exclude such cases?

$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(y+1)-f(x))=xf(y)$
Let $a=f(0)$

Since $\exists y$ such that $f(y)\ne 0$, we immediately get that $f(x)$ is surjective.

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-a)=0$
$P(x,-a-1)$ $\implies$ $f(-f(x))=xf(-a-1)$

If $f(-a-1)\ne 0$, this implies that $f(x)$ is injective and then :
$P(1,x-1)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)-f(1))=f(x-1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x+f(1)-1$ and so :
$\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x+a\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $a\in\mathbb R$

If $f(-a-1)=0$, this implies $f(-f(x))=0$ $\forall x$ and then, since surjective, $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$, impossible in this part of the proof.

	How can we have it is injective???
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	It was obtained that $f(-f(x)) = xf(-a-1)$ for all $x$. Say $f(-a-1) \neq 0$.
Assume $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$; then $0 = f(-f(x_1))  - f(-f(x_2))  = (x_1-x_2)f(-a-1)$, whence $x_1=x_2$, therefore $f$ is injective. 
Maybe working a little longer on a presented solution, rather than quickly shooting a question, will be more beneficial to you (and others like) ...

$P(0,x_2)$ $\implies$ $f(2c)+cx_2=a$
And subtracting, we get $c(x_1-x_2)=0$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2a)=f(ax)$ and so, using previous result, new assertion $Q(x)$ : $f(x+2a)((a-1)x-2a)=0$ $\forall x$

$Q(-2a)$ $\implies$ $a=0$ and then $Q(x)$ becomes $xf(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=0}$ $\forall x$, which indeed is a solution.

I suppose that domain of $f(x)$ is $[-4,4]$ and domain of functional equation is $\{2\}$

then obviously infinitely many solutions exist.

For example $f(x)=2-x$, or also $f(x)=-3\sin \frac{\pi x}2$ ... and general form of solutions is rather simple to find.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/173116}{Sardor}]
	It's not very hard!
Here my longer solution:
Let $ P(x,y) $ be the assertion of the function.
From $ P(x,-y)=P(x,y) $, we get $ (f(y)-f(-y))(f(x+y)+f(x-y)+f(y)+f(-y) (*) $.
We have $ P(0,0)  \implies f(0)=0 $ or $ f(0)=\frac{1}{2} $.
Case 1: $ f(0)=0 $
i) $ P(0,x) \implies f(2x^2)=2f(x)(f(x)+f(-x)) $ and  
$ P(x,0) \implies f(x^2)=f(x)^2 $, thus $ f(x)=f(-x) $ or $ f(x)=-f(-x) $.
If $ f $ is odd, the $ f(2x^2)=0 $, so $ f(x)=0 $ for all $ x \in R_0 $ and since $ f $ is odd, we get $ f(x)=0 $, for any $ x $.
Let  $ f $ is even, then $ f(2x^2)=4f(x)^2=4f(x^2) $, so $ f(2x)=4f(x) $, for any $ x $ ( because $ f $ is even).Taking $ x=y $, in original equation, we get $ 3f(x)^2=2f(x)f(2x)=8f(x)^2 $ or $ f(x)=0 $, for any $ x $.

Case 2: $ f(0)=\frac{1}{2} $.
Then  $ P(x,0) \implies  f(x^2)=f(x)^2+f(x)-\frac{1}{4} $ , so $ f $ is even or $ f(x)+f(-x)+1=0 $
a) $ f(x)=f(-x) $. Then $ P(0,x) \implies f(2x^2)=4f(x)^2-\frac{1}{2} $.Hence
$ (f(x+y)+f(y))(f(x-y)+f(y)=f(x^2)+f(2y^2)=f(x)^2+f(x)+4f(y)^2-\frac{3}{4} $.Then taking $ x=y $ in the least equation  we have $ f(2x)=4f(x)-\frac{3}{2} $ (because $ f(x)=-\frac{1}{2} $ isn't solution).So we have $ 4f(x)^2-\frac{1}{2}=f(2x^2)=4f(x^2)-\frac{3}{2}=4f(x)^2+4f(x)-1-\frac{3}{2} $, so $ f(x)=\frac{1}{2} $
b) Let $ f(x)+f(-x)+1=0 $, then by $ (*) $, we get $ f(x+y)+f(x-y)=1 $ for $ y $ not equal to zero, and taking $ y=x $, we get $ f(x)=\frac{1}{2} $, for any $ x $, but $ 0=f(x)+f(-x)+1=2 $, a contradiction.
Answer:
1) $ f(x)=0 $;
2) $ f(x)=\frac{1}{2} $;

I don't think this line is valid. Even though $ f(x)=f(-x) $ or $ f(x)=-f(-x) $ at any particular x, that doesn't mean $f(x)=f(-x)$ over all x or $f(x)=-f(-x)$ over all x, like you seem to assume in the next few lines.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x)+x+y)=2x+f(y)$

1) problem is equivalent to $f(x)$ additive and $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$
==============================================
$P(x,-f(x))$ $\implies$ $f(x)=2x+f(-f(x))$ and so $f(x)$ is injective.
$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(0))=f(0)$ and so, since injective, $f(0)=0$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)+x)=2x$
$P(-x,x-f(-x))$ $\implies$ $f(x-f(-x))=2x$
And so, since injective, $f(x)+x=x-f(-x)$ and $f(-x)=-f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is odd.

$P(x,-f(x))$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$ (since $f(x)$ is odd) and so $f(x)+x$ is surjective.

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)+x)=2x$ and so $P(x,y)$ implies $f((f(x)+x)+y)=f(f(x)+x)+f(y)$
And so, since $f(x)+x$ is surjective, $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ and $f(x)$ is additive.

And so problem is equivalent to $f(x)$ additive and $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$
Q.E.D.

2) General solution of $f(x)$ additive and $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$
===========================================
2.1) Claim about general form
----------------------------------
Let $A,B$ two supplementary subvectorspaces of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
let $a(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to A$ and $b(x)$ from $\mathbb R\to B$ the two projections of $x$ in A,B (so that $x=a(x)+b(x)$ in a unique way
Then $f(x)=a(x)-2b(x)$

2.2) Proof that functions in the form of 2.1 indeed are solutions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
$f(x)=a(x)-2b(x)$ is trivially additive
$f(f(x))=a(x)+4b(x)$ and so $f(f(x))+f(x)=a(x)+4b(x)+a(x)-2b(x)=2(a(x)+b(x))=2x$
Q.E.D.

2.3) Proof that any solution may be put in the form in 2.1, so that this indeed is a general solution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let $f(x)$ a solution (additive function such that $f(f(x))+f(x)=2x$)
Let $A=\{x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f(x)=x\}$ : $A$ is obviously a subvectorspace of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
Let $B=\{x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f(x)=-2x\}$ : $B$ is obviously a subvectorspace of the $\mathbb Q$-vectorspace $\mathbb R$
If $x\in A\cap B$, then $f(x)=x=-2x$ and so $A\cap B=\{0\}$

Let $a(x)=\frac{f(x)+2x}3$ : $f(a(x))=\frac{f(f(x))+2f(x)}3$ $=\frac{f(x)+2x}3$ $=a(x)$ and so $a(x)\in A$

Let $b(x)=\frac{x-f(x)}3$ : $f(b(x))=\frac{f(x)-f(f(x))}3$ $=\frac{2f(x)-2x}3$ $=-2b(x)$ and so $b(x)\in B$

$a(x)+b(x)=x$ and so $A,B$ are supplementary.

And $a(x)-2b(x)=f(x)$
Q.E.D.

2.4) Examples
-----------------
$(A,B)=(\mathbb R,\{0\})$ gives $f(x)=x$
$(A,B)=(\{0\},\mathbb R)$ gives $f(x)=-2x$
And infinitely many other solutions (using axiom of choice and Hamel basis)

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and such that :
\[f(2yf(x)+x^2)+f(y^2)=f^2(x+y),\;\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
The only constant solutions are $\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ and $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=2\text{  }\forall x}$.
So let us from now look only for non constant solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(2yf(x)+x^2)+f(y^2)=f(x+y)^2$

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)+f(0)=f(x)^2$
$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(0)x)+f(x^2)=f(x)^2$
Subtracting, we get $f(2f(0)x)=f(0)$ and so $f(0)=0$ since $f(x)$ is not constant.

$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=f(x)^2$ and so $f(x)\ge 0$ $\forall x\ge 0$
As a consequence, $f(2yf(x)+x^2)\ge 0$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$ and so $f(x+y)^2\ge f(y)^2$ and $f(x+y)\ge f(y)\ge 0$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$
So $f(x)$ is non decreasing over $[0,+\infty)$

If $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$, then $P(x,-\frac x2)$ $\implies$ $f(-xf(x)+x^2)=0$ and so $\boxed{\text{S3 : }f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution.

If $f(u)=0$ for some $u\ne 0$, $f(-u)^2=f(u^2)=f(u)^2=0$ and so WLOG consider $u>0$
Let then $x\ge 0$ : $P(u,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x+u)^2=f(x)^2$ and so $f(x+u)=f(x)$ since both are $\ge 0$
As a consequence $f(nu)=0$ and so, since non negative and non decreasing over $[0,+\infty)$ : $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\ge 0$

Then, since $f(-x)^2=f(x)^2$, we get $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$ which is not a solution in this part of the proof.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x+y))=f(x+y)+f(x)f(y)-xy$
$f(x)=0$$\forall x$ is not a solution. So let $u,v$ such that $f(u)=v\ne 0$

If $f(0)=0$ :
$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+u))=f(x+u)+vf(x)-ux$
$P(x+u,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+u))=f(x+u)$
Subtracting, we get $f(x)=\frac uvx$ and plugging this back in original eaquation, we get $\boxed{f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$ 

If $f(0)\ne 0$, let $a=\frac 1{f(0)}\ne 0$ :
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+y))=f(x+y)+f(x)f(y)-xy$
$P(x+y,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x+y))=f(x+y)+\frac 1af(x+y)$
Subtracting, we get new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x+y)=af(x)f(y)-axy$

$Q(2,x)$ $\implies$ $f((1+1)+x)=af(1+1)f(x)-a(1+1)x$ $=a^2f(1)f(1)f(x)-a^2f(x)-2ax$
$Q(1+x,1)$ $\implies$ $f((1+x)+1)=af(1+x)f(1)-a(1+x)$ $=a^2f(1)f(1)f(x)-a^2xf(1)-a-ax$
Subtracting, we get $f(x)=x(f(1)-f(0))+f(0)$
Plugging this back in original equation, we get no solution with $f(0)\ne 0$

	Find all function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that

$f\left ( f\left ( x-y \right ) \right )=f ( x )-f(y)+f(x).f(y)-xy  ,\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(f(x-y))=f(x)-f(y)+f(x)f(y)-xy$
Let $a=f(0)$
Note that $P(x,y)$ implies that $f(x)$ can not be bounded

$P(f(x),f(x))$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))^2=f(x)^2+f(a)$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=(a+1)f(x)-a$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))^2=(a^2+2a+1)f(x)^2-2a(a+1)f(x)+a^2$
Subtracting, we get $a(a+2)f(x)^2-2a(a+1)f(x)+a^2-f(a)=0$
If $a\ne 0$, this implies that $f(x)$ can only take one or two values, and so is bounded, impossible. So $a=0$

$P(x,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)^2=x^2$ and so $\forall x$, either $f(x)=x$, either $f(x)=-x$

Suppose now $\exists x,y\ne 0$ such that $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=-y$
$P(x,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x-y))=x+y-2xy$ and so :
either $x-y=x+y-2xy$ and $x=1$
either $y-x=x+y-2xy$ and $y=1$
So :
Either $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution
Either $f(x)=-x$ $\forall x$ which is not a solution
Either $f(x)=x$ $\forall x\ne 1$ and $f(1)=-1$ which is not a solution
Either $f(x)=-x$ $\forall x\ne 1$ and $f(1)=1$ which is not a solution

I suppose that condition $\forall x,y,xy(x+y)\ne 0$ in condition c is available too for condition b. Else obviously no solution.

Setting $g(x)$ from $\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb R$ as $g(x)=f(\frac 1x)$, condition b implies $g(x)$ is additive.

Appling condition c for $x=\frac 1t$ and $y=\frac 1{1-t}$ for $t\notin\{0,1\}$, we get, using $g(1)=1$ and $g(x)$ additive :
$g(t^2)=g(t)^2\ge 0$, still true when $t=1$

So $g(x)$ is non decreasing and so $g(x)=x$ $\forall x\ne 0$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=\frac 1x\text{  }\forall x\ne 0}$ which indeed is a solution.

Setting $x=0$ in b), we get $f(0)=0$ and so, since injective, $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\ne 0$
Setting $x=1$ in b), we get $f(1)=1$ and so, since injective, $f(x)\ne 1$ $\forall x\ne 1$

Let then $u\in(0,1)$ and $v=f(u)\in(0,1)$ :
From $f(u)=v$, applying c) for $x=u$, we get $f(2u-v)=u$
From $f(2u-v)=u$, applying c) for $x=2u-v$, we get $f(3u-2v)=2u-v$
And simple induction gives $f((n+1)u-nv)=nu-(n-1)v$
And so $0\le nu-(n-1)v\le 1$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$

And so $\frac{n-1}n\le \frac uv \le \frac{n-1}n+\frac 1{nv}$
Setting $n\to+\infty$ in this inequality, we get $u=v$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x\in[0,1]}$ which indeed is a solution.

$P(\frac{x+1}2,\frac{x-1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x+1}2g(\frac{x+1}2)-\frac{x-1}2g(\frac{x-1}2)=g(x)$

Equation is $f(x-y)^2+f(x+y)^2=2f(x)^2$ and so, setting $g(x)=f(x)^2$ :

This is a quite classical problem whose only solution is $g(x)=a$ $\forall x$ and for some $a>0$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^3+2y)+f(x+y)=g(x+2y)$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=f(x^3)+f(x)$ and $P(x,y)$ implies new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $f(x^3+2y)+f(x+y)=f((x+2y)^3)+f(x+2y)$
$Q(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f((2x)^3)=f(x)$ and so $Q(x,y)$ may be written as $R(x,y)$ : $f(x^3+2y)+f(x+y)=f(\frac x2+y)+f(x+2y)$
$R(1,x-\frac 12)$ $\implies$ $f(x+\frac 12)=f(x)$ and so $f(x)$ is periodic
Subtracting $R(x,y)$ from $R(x+1,y)$, we get then $f((x+1)^3+2y)=f(x^3+2y)$

Let then $u-v\ge \frac 14$ :
Let $x$ any real root of $(x+1)^3-x^3=u-v$ and $y=\frac {v-x^3}2$ : last equality means $f(u)=f(v)$

And so $f(x)=f(y)$ $\forall x\ge y+\frac 14$ and it is then elementary to conclude that $f(x)$ is constant.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $ f,g,h: \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} $  such that

$f\left ( x+y^{3} \right )+g\left ( x^{3} +y\right )=h(xy),\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}$\end{tcolorbox}
If $f,g,h$ are solution, so are $f(x)-f(0),g(x)-g(0), h(x)-f(0)-g(0)$. So WLOG consider $f(0)=g(0)=0$

Swapping $x,y$ and subtracting from original equation, we get $(f-g)(x+y^3)=(f-g)(x^3+y)$ and so easily $f-g$ constant and so $g(x)=f(x)$ 
Hence assertion $P(x,y)$ : $f(x+y^3)+f(x^3+y)=h(xy)$ 

$P(x,yz)$ $\implies$ $f(x+y^3z^3)+f(x^3+yz)=h(xyz)$ 
$P(y,xz)$ $\implies$ $f(y+x^3z^3)+f(y^3+xz)=h(xyz)$ 
Subtracting, we get $f(x+y^3z^3)+f(x^3+yz)=f(y+x^3z^3)+f(y^3+xz)$
Consider now $v\ne 0$ and $u\ne \pm v$ and $u\ne v^9$ and the system :
$x^3+yz=y+x^3z^3$
$x+y^3z^3=u$
$y^3+xz=v$

$u\ne \pm v$ implies $z\ne \pm 1$ and cancelling $y^3$ between second and third gives $x=\frac{vz^3-u}{z^4-1}$
First lines gives then $y=x^3(z^2+z+1)=\frac{(vz^3-u)^3(z^2+z+1)}{(z^4-1)^3}$

Plugging these values in third line gives $(vz^3-u)^9(z^2+z+1)^3+z(vz^3-u)(z^4-1)^8-v(z^4-1)^9=0$
It's easy to see that greatest degree summand is $(v^9-u)z^{33}$ and that $z=\pm 1$ is not a root
So $\exists x,y,z\ne \pm 1$ matching the system

And so $f(u)=f(v)$ $\forall v\ne 0$ and $u\ne \pm v$ and $u\ne v^9$
Easy step to get that $f(x)$ is constant, and so is $g(x)$ and so is $h(x)$

Hence the answer : $\boxed{f(x)=a\text{ and }g(x)=b\text{ and }h(x)=a+b\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b,c\in\mathbb R$

	Given $ k \in \mathbb{R} $. Find all $ f: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} $ 
satisfy $ f(yf(x+y)+f(x))=k^2x+kyf(y) $
	\flushright \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h618365}{(Link to AoPS)}
\end{problem}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/212018}{Tintarn}]
	I have a solution for all cases except $k=0$.
First case: $k=1$. Then the equation writes as:
$f(yf(x+y)+f(x))=x+yf(y)$
$y=0$ implies $f(f(x))=x$ hence $f$ is an involution and therefore a bijection.
Thus, there exists unique $a$ such that $f(a)=0$ and $f(0)=a$.
Inserting $y=a$ in the original equation implies $f(af(x+a)+f(x))=x=f(f(x))$ and hence because of injectivity $af(x+a)=0$ and therefore $a=0$ as $f(x)=0$ for every $x$ is not a solution.
Now, $x=0, y=1$ in the original equation implies $1=f(f(1))=f(1)$ and hence $f(1)=1$.
Finally, $y=1$ in the original equation yields $f(f(x+1)+f(x))=x+1=f(f(x+1))$ and by injectivity $f(x)=0$ for every $x$ but this is obviously not a solution. Hence, in this case no solution exists.
The case $k=-1$ works similarly.

Let us from now on assume $k \ne 0$ and $k^2 \ne 1$.
Then $y=0$ implies $f(f(x))=k^2x$ and therefore $f(k^2x)=k^2f(x)$ and hence $f(0)=0$.
Now, $y=-x$ in the original equation yields $k^2x=f(f(x))=k^2x-kxf(-x)$ and hence $f(x)=0$ for every $x$ which is obviously no solution.

Hence, for $k \ne 0$ the equation has no solution.
In case of $k=0$ the equation writes as $f(yf(x+y)+f(x))=0$ which immediately yields $f(f(x))=0$ and $f(0)=0$. Obviously, $f(x) \equiv 0$ is a solution but I could not yet prove that it is the only one.

In this case, a lot of non allzero solutions exist.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/219179}{huricane}]
	Such function does not exist.Suppose that there exists such function.Then $f(f(x))+f(f(x)+1)=x+(1-x)=1,\forall x\in\mathbb{R}(1)$.Plugging $x=f(t),t\in\mathbb{R}$ in $(1)$ we obtain $f(f(f(t)))+f(f(f(t))+1)=f(t)+f(t+1)=1$.
Therefore $f(t)+f(t+1)=1 \forall t\in\mathbb{R}$.From $f(t)+f(t+1)=f(t+1)+f(t+2)=1$ we get $f(t)=f(t+2)$,which means $t=f(f(t))=f(f(t+2))=t+2 \forall t\in\mathbb{R}$,contradiction.

$f(x)$ is injective.
Setting $x=\frac 12$ in both equalities, we get $f(f(\frac 12))=f(f(\frac 12)+1)=\frac 12$ and so, since injective, $f(\frac 12)=f(\frac 12)+1$

Hence the result : no such function.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy)f(x+y)=1$

Let $x,y>0$ and $z> 2\max(\sqrt x,\sqrt y)$
Let $u_1,v_1$ the two distinct positive real roots of $X^2-zX+x=0$ : $P(u_1,v_1)$ $\implies$ $f(x)f(z)=1$
Let $u_2,v_2$ the two distinct positive real roots of $X^2-zX+y=0$ : $P(u_2,v_2)$ $\implies$ $f(y)f(z)=1$

If $f(u)=0$ for some $u$, then choosing $x=2t-u$ and $y=u$ implies $f(t)=0$ $\forall t$

If $f(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x$, then continuity implies that $f(x)$ has constant sign and since $f(x)$ solution implies $-f(x)$ solution, WLOG say $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$

Let then $g(x)=\ln f(x)$, continuous, and we get $g(\frac{x+y}2)=\frac{g(x)+g(y)}2$ and so (very classical) $g(x)=ax+b$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=c e^{ax}\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,c\in\mathbb R$
Note that $c=e^b>0$ from previous lines but we can choose also $c=0$ (first solution) or $=-e^b<0$ since $f(x)$ solution implies $-f(x)$ solution.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^2f(x)+f(y))=f(x)^3+y$
Let $a=f(0)$

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x))=x+a^3$ and so $f(x)$ is continuous bijective (and so monotonous) and so $x^2f(x)$ is surjective.
Let $b=f^{-1}(0)$ : $P(x,b)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2f(x))=f(x)^3+b$

So $f(x^2f(x)+f(y))=f(x^2f(x))+f(f(y))-(a^3+b)$ And so, since both $f(x)$ and $x^2f(x)$ are surjective : $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)-(a^3+b)$

Continuity implies then $f(x)=ux+v$ for some $u,v$ and plugging this in original equation gives $u=1$ and $v=0$

And so $\boxed{f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution.

Let $x>y$, and the sequences $x_1=x$, $x_{n+1}=\frac{x_n+y_n}2$, $y_1=y$, $y_{n+1}=\frac {2x_ny_n}{x_n+y_n}$

It's immediate to get that $x_n>x_{n+1}>y_{n+1}>y_n$ so that both sequences are convergent and have the same limit.
And since $x_{n+1}y_{n+1}=x_ny_n=xy$, this limit is ${\sqrt {xy}}$

Now, $f(x_{n+1})+f(y_{n+1})=f(x_n)+f(y_n)=...=f(x)+f(y)$ and continuity implies $f(x)+f(y)=2f(\sqrt{xy})$

Setting $g(x)=f(e^x)$, we get $g(\frac{x+y}2)=\frac{g(x)+g(y)}2$, whose only continuous solutions are classicaly $g(x)=ax+b$

So $f(x)=a\ln x + b$ and so, since positive, $a=0$ and $b>0$ and $\boxed{f(x)=b\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever is $b>0$

I'm really sorry but I dont succeed :

$(x,y)(z,w)$ gives $f(x)+f(y)+f(z)+f(w)$ $=f(\frac{x+y}2)+f(\frac{2xy}{x+y})+f(\frac{z+w}2)+f(\frac{2zw}{z+w})$

Setting  $y=w=\sqrt{xz}$, this becomes :
$f(x)+f(z)+2f(\sqrt{xz})$ $=f(\frac{x+\sqrt{xz}}2)+f(\frac{2x\sqrt{xz}}{x+\sqrt{xz}})+f(\frac{z+\sqrt{xz}}2)+f(\frac{2z\sqrt{xz}}{z+\sqrt{xz}})$

Setting $x=0$ in equation, we get $f(0)\ge 0$
Setting $x=1$ in equation, we get $f(1)\le 0$

If $f(x)>0$ for some $\in(0,1)$, then consider the increasing sequence $x_n=x^{2^{-n}}$ :
$f(x_{n+1})\ge 2x_{n+1}f(x_n)$ and so $f(x_n)>0$ $\forall n$
Since $x_n$ is increasing with limit $1$, $x_{n+1}>\frac 12$ from a given point and then $f(x_{n+1})>f(x_n)>0$ from this point.
Continuity implies then $f(1)>0$, impossible. 
So $f(x)\le 0$ $\forall x\in(0,1)$ and so $f(x)\le 0$ $\forall x\in[0,1]$ and so $f(0)=0$

If $f(x)<0$ for some $x\in(0,\frac 12)$,  then consider the decreasing sequence $x_n=x^{2^{n}}<\frac 12$ :
$f(x_n)\ge 2x_nf(x_{n+1})>f(x_{n+1})$  and so $f(x_n)$ is a negative decreasing sequence and continuity im^plies $f(0)<0$, impossible.

So $f(x)=0$ $\forall x\in[0,\frac 12)$

Posted a lot of times. Maybe you could walk a little thru the forum before flooding with old problems ...

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $xf(x)-yf(y)=(x-y)f(x+y)$

$P(\frac{x+1}2,\frac{x-1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x+1}2f(\frac{x+1}2)-\frac{x-1}2f(\frac{x-1}2)=f(x)$

$P(\frac{x-1}2,\frac{1-x}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{x-1}2f(\frac{x-1}2)-\frac{1-x}2f(\frac{1-x}2)=(x-1)f(0)$

$P(\frac{1-x}2,\frac{x+1}2)$ $\implies$ $\frac{1-x}2f(\frac{1-x}2-\frac{x+1}2f(\frac{x+1}2)=-xf(1)$

Adding these three lines, we get $f(x)=x(f(1)-f(0))+f(0)$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=ax+b\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $a,b\in\mathbb R$
And, btw, no need for continuity here.

b)$f\left ( \frac{x+y}{2} \right )\leq f(x)+f(y),\forall x,y\in \left [ 0;1 \right ]$\end{tcolorbox}
Setting $y=0$, we get $f(x)\ge f(\frac x2)$ and so $f(x)\ge f(\frac x{2^n})$ and so, with continuity, $f(x)\ge f(0)=0$

If $f(x)=f(y)=0$ then we get $0\le f(\frac{x+y}2)\le 0$ and so $f(\frac {x+y}2)=0$

So, simple induction, starting with $f(0)=f(1)=0$ gives $f(\frac n{2^m})=0$ $\forall m\in\mathbb N$, $\forall n\in\{0,1,2,...,2^m\}$

And continuity implies then $\boxed{f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x\in[0,1]}$ which indeed is a solution.

Since you posted in this "proposed and own" category, this means that you have a solution and are just looking for another one.
Please, post your own solution, please.

Hereunder is mine

\begin{tcolorbox}Find value $a$ , where sum of real roots of equation $\frac{f(a)x^2 +1}{x^2+g(a)}=\sqrt{\frac{xg(a)-1}{f(a)-x}}$ was minimum value , and $f(a)=a^2-a\sqrt{20} +23$ , $g(a)=1,5a^2-a\sqrt{20}+24$\end{tcolorbox}
For easier writing, let $u=f(a)=a^2-a\sqrt{20}+23$ and $v=g(a)=\frac 32a^2-a\sqrt{20}+24$
1) some preliminary results
1.1 : $u=(a-\sqrt 5)^2+18\ge 18$
1.2 : $v=\frac 32(a-\frac{2\sqrt 5}3)^2+\frac{62}3\ge \frac{62}3$
1.3 : using previous results, we trivially have $uv\ge 3$ and so $\frac 1v<\frac 2v<\frac {2u}3<u$
1.4 : $4u < v^2$
$4v^2-16u=(3a^2-4a\sqrt{5}+48)^2-16(a^2-2a\sqrt{5}+23)$ $=9a^4-24\sqrt 5a^3+352a^2-352\sqrt 5a+1936$
$=(3a^2-4a\sqrt 5+44)^2+8a^2$ $>0$
Q.E.D.
1.5 : $2u^2 > 9v$
$4u^2-18v=4(a^2-2a\sqrt 5+23)^2-9(3a^2-4a\sqrt 5+48)$ $=4a^4-16\sqrt 5a^3+237a^2-332\sqrt 5a+1684$
$=(2a^2-4a\sqrt 5+37)^2+9(a-2\sqrt 5)^2+135$ $>0$
Q.E.D

2) solution
2.1 get an equivalent cubic
Equation is $\frac{ux^2+1}{x^2+v}=\sqrt{\frac{vx-1}{u-x}}$ and is only defined when $x\in[\frac 1v,u)$ (remember $uv>3>1$)

$\iff$ $x-\frac{ux^2+1}{x^2+v}=x-\sqrt{\frac{vx-1}{u-x}}$

$\iff$ $\frac{x^3-ux^2+vx-1}{x^2+v}$ $=\frac{x^2-\frac{vx-1}{u-x}}{x+\sqrt{\frac{vx-1}{u-x}}}$ $=-\frac{x^3-ux^2+vx-1}{(u-x)(x+\sqrt{\frac{vx-1}{u-x}})}$

$\iff$ $(x^3-ux^2+vx-1)\left(\frac 1{x^2+v}+\frac{1}{(u-x)(x+\sqrt{\frac{vx-1}{u-x}})}\right)=0$

$\iff$ $x\in[\frac 1v,u)$ and $x^3-ux^2+vx-1=0$ (other factor is $>0$)

2.2 Prove that equivalent cubic has no complex root and that all real roots are in the good interval
Let $P(x)=x^3-ux^2+vx-1$

$P(\frac 1v)=\frac 1{v^3}-\frac u{v^2}=\frac{1-uv}{v^3}$ $<0$ (see 1.3 above)

$P(\frac 2v)=\frac 8{v^3}-\frac{4u}{v^2}+1$ $=\frac 8{v^3}+\frac {v^2-4u}{v^2}$ $>0$ (see 1.4 above)

$P(\frac{2u}3)=\frac{8u^3}{27}-\frac{4u^3}9+\frac{2uv}3-1$ $=\frac{2u(9v-2u^2)}{27}-1$ $<0$ (see 1.5 above)

$P(u)=uv-1$ $>0$ (see 1.3 above)

So we have indeed three distinct real roots in the suitable interval and so the sum of all real roots is exactly the sum of all roots and  is $u$ whose minimum is $18$ when $\boxed{a=\sqrt 5}$ (see 1.1 above)

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(x)+y^2)=x^2+yf(y)$

$P(0,0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$
$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x^2)=xf(x)$
$P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x))=x^2$
$P(xf(x),0)$ $\implies$ $f(xf(x)f(xf(x)))=x^2f(x)^2$ $\implies$ $f(x^3f(x))=x^2f(x)^2$
$P(x^2,0)$ $\implies$  $f(x^2f(x^2))=x^4$ $\implies$ $f(x^3f(x))=x^4$

And so $f(x)^2=x^2$ $\forall x\ne 0$, still true when $x=0$ and so $\forall x$ : either $f(x)=x$, either $f(x)=-x$
Suppose now that $\exists a,b\ne 0$ such that $f(a)=a$ and $f(b)=-b$
$P(a,b)$ $\implies$ $f(a^2+b^2)=a^2-b^2$ and so :
either $a^2+b^2=a^2-b^2$ and so $b=0$ impossible
either $-(a^2+b^2)=a^2-b^2$ and so $a=0$, impossible

And so :
either $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution
either $\boxed{f(x)=-x}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/89198}{chaotic_iak}]
	EDIT: Failed attempt.

Fix an integer $n$. Let $(u_i)$ be the sequence $u_0 = n, u_{k+1} = f(u_k)$ for all nonnegative integer $k$. Let $x = u_{k-1}$ for a positive integer $k$, then $u_{k+1} = u_k + a$ from the condition. Also, $u_{k+2} = u_{k+1} + a$ (set $k \leftarrow k+1$), so $u_{k+2} - 2u_{k+1} + u_k = 0$. This gives the characteristic polynomial $\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0$, so $\lambda = 1, 1$, and so $u_k = A(1^k) + B(1^k \cdot k)$ for some $A,B$. So $u_k = A + Bk$. Since $u_0 = n$, we have $A = n$.

Substituting back to the original equation $u_2 = u_1 + a$, we have $(n+2B) = (n+B) + a$, so $B = a$ for any $n$. Thus $f(n) = u_1 = n+a$ for any $n$, which can be verified to work.

You got $u_{k+1}=u_k+a$ $\forall k\ge 1$ (and NOT for $k=0$) and so your conclusion is not available for $n=0$ and all you got is $f^{[n]}(x)=f(x)+(n-1)a$ $\forall n\ge 1$. That's all.

Let $P(x)$ be the assertion $f(f(x))=f(x)+a$

1) If $a=0$
==========
Equation is $f(f(x))=f(x)$ $\forall x\in \mathbb Z$ and so, since injective, $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Z$, which indeed is a solution

2) If $a\ne 0$
==========
Let $A=\{x\in\mathbb Z$ such that $f(x)=x+a\}$
$f(\mathbb Z)\in A$
If $x\in A$, then $P(x)$ $\implies$ $x+a\in A$

Let $B=\{x\in A$ such that $x-a\notin A\}$
$|B|\le |a|$
If $x\notin A$, $f(x)\in B$ and so at most $|a|$ such $x$
But $x\notin A$ $\implies$ $f(x)-ka\notin A$ $\forall k\in\mathbb Z$ and so contradiction

So $|B|=0$ and so $x\in A$ $\forall x$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x+a}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Z$, which indeed is a solution.

\[f(x^3+2f(y))=f^3(x)+y+f(y),\;\forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x^3+2f(y))=f(x)^3+y+f(y)$
$f(x)$ is injective
$P(\sqrt[3]{-x^3-2f(-x^3)},-x^3)$ $\implies$ $f(\sqrt[3]{-x^3-2f(-x^3)})=x$ and so $f(x)$ is surjective.
Let then $a=f(0)$ and $u$ such that $f(u)=0$

$P(0,y)$ $\implies$ $f(2f(y))=a^3+y+f(y)$
$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(x^3)=f(x)^3+u$
$P(0,u)$ $\implies$ $a=a^3+u$
And so $f(x^3+2f(y))=f(x^3)+f(2f(y)-a$ and so, since surjective, $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)-a$ and so $f(x)-a$ is additive.

$P(x+p,u)$ $\implies$ $f(x^3+3px^2+3p^2x+p^3)$ $=(f(x)+pf(1)-a)^3+u$
$\implies$ $p^3(f(1)^3-f(1)+a)$ $+3p^2(f(1)^2(f(x)-a)-f(x)+a)$ $+3p(f(1)(f(x)-a)^2-f(x^2)+a)$ $+(f(x)-a)^3+u-f(x^3)=0$
This a cubic which is zero for any rational and so each coefficient is zero.
So $f(1)(f(x)-a)^2-f(x^2)+a=0$ and so $f(x^2)=f(1)(f(x)-a)^2+a$  and so $f(x)$ is lower bounded over $\mathbb R^+$ and so is continuous an $f(x)=\alpha x+a$
Plugging this back in original equation, we get $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=0$ and so $\boxed{f(x)=x}$ $\forall x$

1) find a specific solution for $g(x)=g'(x)+\sin^4x$
$\sin^4(x)=\left(\frac{1-\cos 2x}2\right)^2$ $=\frac 14-\frac 12\cos 2x+\frac 14\cos^22x$ $=\frac 14-\frac 12\cos 2x+\frac 14\frac{1+\cos 4x}2$ $=\frac 38-\frac 12\cos 2x+\frac 18\cos 4x$ 

1.1) find a specific solution for $h_1(x)=h_1'(x)+1$
We easily get $h_1(x)=1$

1.2) find a specific solution for $h_2(x)=h_2'(x)+\cos 2x$
Setting $h_2(x)=a\sin 2x + b\cos 2x$, we get $h_2(x)=-\frac 25\sin 2x+\frac 15\cos 2x$

1.3) find a specific solution for $h_3(x)=h_3'(x)+\cos 4x$

Obviously, choosing $g(x)=\frac 38h_1(x)-\frac 12h_2(x)+\frac 18h_3(x)$ is a solution.

We trivially have then $F(x)=ke^x+\frac 38+\frac 15\sin 2x-\frac 1{10}\cos 2x-\frac 1{34}\sin 4x+\frac 1{136}\cos 4x$

And so $f(x)=F'(x)=ke^x+\frac 25\cos 2x+\frac 1{5}\sin 2x-\frac 2{17}\cos 4x-\frac 1{34}\sin 4x$

3) Solution to the given problem
Adding the condition $f(0)=1$, we get $k=\frac{61}{85}$

Hence the solution $\boxed{f(x)=\frac{61}{85}e^x+\frac 25\cos 2x+\frac 1{5}\sin 2x-\frac 2{17}\cos 4x-\frac 1{34}\sin 4x}$

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xf(y))f(y)=f(x+y)$
If $x\ge 2$, $P(x-2,2)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$ and so $f(x)=0$ $\iff$ $x\ge 2$

If $x<2$ : 
Let $y\ge 2-x$ : $P(y,x)$ $\implies$ $f(yf(x))=0$ $\implies$ $f(x)\ge \frac 2y$ $\implies$ $f(x)\ge \frac 2{2-x}$
Let $y < 2-x$ : $P(y,x)$ $\implies$ $f(yf(x))\ne 0$ $\implies$ $f(x)<\frac 2y$ $\implies$ $f(x)\le \frac 2{2-x}$

For the first, choose $y=2-x\ge 2-x$ and so $f(x)\ge\frac 2y$ becomes $f(x)\ge \frac 2{2-x}$

For the second, choose $y=2-x-\frac 1n<2-x$ and so $f(x)<\frac 2y$ becomes $f(x)< \frac 2{2-x-\frac 1n}$ and, setting $n\to+\infty$,  $f(x)\le \frac 2{2-x}$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f:R\to R$ such that:
 $f(xy+f(x))=xf(y)+f(x)$\end{tcolorbox}
$\boxed{\text{S1 : }f(x)=0\text{  }\forall x}$ is a solution. So let us from now look only for non allzero solutions.
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy+f(x))=xf(y)+f(x)$
Let $a$ such that $f(a)\ne 0$
Let $u=f(-1)+1$

$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$ $f(u)=0$
$P(x,u)$ $\implies$ $f(f(x)+ux)=f(x)$
$P(x,f(x)+ux)$ $\implies$ $f(x(f(x)+ux)+f(x))=(x+1)f(x)$
$P(f(x)+ux,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x(f(x)+ux)+f(x))=(f(x)+ux+1)f(x)$
Subtracting, we get $f(x)(f(x)+(u-1)x)=0$ $\forall x$ and so $\forall x$, either $f(x)=0$, either $f(x)=(1-u)x$
Note that this implies that $f(0)=0$ and $f(a)=(1-u)a$ and so $u\ne 1$ and $a\ne 0$
$P(a,0)$ $\implies$ $f((1-u)a)=(1-u)a$ and so so $u=0$
If $\exists v\ne 0$ such that $f(v)=0$, then $P(a,v)$ $\implies$ $f(av+(1-u)a)=(1-u)a$ and, since $RHS\ne 0$, we get $(1-u)(av+(1-u)a))=(1-u)a$ and so $u=v$, impossible since $u=0$

So $\boxed{\text{S2 : }f(x)=x\text{  }\forall x}$ which indeed is a solution.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/153258}{khoa_liv29}]
	Thanks for your nice solution. :D This is my solution: (this one is based on yours :D)
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy+f(x))=xf(y)+f(x)$
$P(x,0) \Rightarrow f(f(x))=f(x)+xf(0)$
$\bullet$ If $f(0)=0$ we have $f(f(x))=f(x)$
$P(f(x),x) \Rightarrow f(f(x).x+f(x))=f(x)^2+f(x)$
$P(x,f(x)) \Rightarrow f(xf(x)+f(x))=xf(x)+f(x)$
Thus we have $f(x)^2=xf(x) \Rightarrow f(x)=0$ or $f(x)=x$
If there exist $a,b \in R, a \neq b \neq 0$: $P(a,b) \Rightarrow ab+b=b$, we have contradiction.
Thus $f(x)=x$ for all $x$ and $f(x)=0$ for all $x$ are the solutions.
$\bullet$ If $f(0) \neq 0$ we have $f(x)$ is injective.
$P(0,y) \Rightarrow f(f(0))=f(0) \Rightarrow f(0)=0$, we have contradiction.
So $f(x)=x$ for all $x$ and $f(x)=0$ for all $x$ are all the solutions.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	The reason your teacher invoked for the presence of injectivity in the statement of the problem is a fallacy. Who cares about the possible adherence values of the sequence $(x_n)$, when the only time we deal with such a sequence is when $(f(x_n))$ is convergent to some $f(a)$? in which case \begin{bolded}we are told \end{bolded}$(x_n)$ is convergent, thus it has only one adherence point (its limit).

Notice that if we are just told $(f(x_n))$ is convergent, forcing $(x_n)$ to be convergent to some limit $\lim_{n\to \infty} x_n =\ell$, it does not necessarily follow that $\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) =f(\ell)$, even if we know $f$ to be injective. An example is any function with a jump discontinuity.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)+f(xy-1)=f(x)f(y)+a$

1) Constant solutions
==============
If $x^2-2x+a=0$ has integer solutions (in fact if $a=1-n^2$), then we have the solutions :
$\boxed{S_1 : a=1-n^2\text{ gives }f(x)=1+n\text{  }\forall n}$

$\boxed{S_2 : a=1-n^2\text{ gives }f(x)=1-n\text{  }\forall n}$

2)Non constant solutions
=================
Let $b=f(1)$

2.1) $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=a$ and $b=a$ and $a\in\{-2,-1,1,2\}$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If $f(0)\ne 1$ : $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)-a=f(x)(f(0)-1)$ and so $f(x)$ is contant, impossible. So $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=a$

$P(-1,1)$ $\implies$  $f(-2)=ab+a-1$
$P(-1,-1)$ $\implies$  $f(-2)=a^2+a-1$
Subtracting, we get $b=a$ (remember $a\ne 0$)

$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=a$
$P(1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(2)=a^2+a-1$
$P(2,1)$ $\implies$ $f(3)=a^3+a^2-a$
$P(3,1)$ $\implies$ $f(4)=a^4+a^3-2a^2+1$
$P(4,1)$ $\implies$ $f(5)=a^5+a^4-3a^3-a^2+3a$
$P(3,2)$ $\implies$ $(a-2)(a-1)(a+1)(a+2)=0$
Q.E.D.

2.2) Case where $a=b=-2$ 
----------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-2f(x+1)-f(x)-2$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_3 : a=-2\text{ gives }f(2n)=1\text{  and }f(2n+1)=-2\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.3) Case where $a=b=-1$ 
---------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)-1$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_4 : a=-1\text{ gives }f(3n)=1\text{  and }f(3n+1)=-1\text{  and }f(3n+2)=-1\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.4) Case where $a=b=1$ 
------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)-1$
Simple induction gives $f(n)=1$, which indeed is a solution, already noted in the paragraph "constant solutions"

2.5) Case where $a=b=2$ 
-------------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=2f(x+1)-f(x)+2$

Uhhh ?, this is exactly the same exercise. You should have found alone from the previous one , according to me.

Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)+f(xy-1)=f(x)f(y)$

1) Constant solutions
==============
We immediately get two constant solutions :
$\boxed{S_1 : f(x)=0\text{   }\forall x}$

$\boxed{S_2 : f(x)=2\text{   }\forall x}$

2)Non constant solutions
=================
2.1) $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=0$ and $f(1)\in \{-1,0,2\}$
-------------------------------------------------
Let $b=f(1)$
If $f(0)\ne 1$ : $P(x,0)$ $\implies$ $f(-1)=f(x)(f(0)-1)$ and so $f(x)$ is contant, impossible. So $f(0)=1$ and $f(-1)=0$

$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=bf(x+1)-f(x)$ and so :
$f(-1)=0$
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=b$
$f(2)=b^2-1$
$f(3)=b^3-2b$
$f(4)=b^4-3b^2+1$

$P(2,2)$ $\implies$ $b(b+1)(b-2)=0$ and so $b\in\{-1,0,2\}$
Q.E.D.

2.2) Case where $f(1)=-1$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=-1$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x+1)-f(x)$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_3 : f(3n)=1\text{  and }f(3n+1)=-1\text{  and }f(3n+2)=0\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.3) Case where $f(1)=0$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=0$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=-f(x)$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_4 : f(2n)=(-1)^n\text{  and }f(2n+1)=0\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution

2.4) Case where $f(1)=2$ 
--------------------------
$f(0)=1$
$f(1)=2$
$P(x+1,1)$ $\implies$ $f(x+2)=2f(x+1)-f(x)$
Simple induction gives :

$\boxed{S_5 : f(n)=n+1\text{  }\forall n}$

which indeed is a solution
\end{solution}

	Find all functions $f,g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is strictly increasing and \[f(xy)=f(x)g(y)+f(y)\quad \forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\]

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all functions $f,g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is strictly increasing and \[f(xy)=f(x)g(y)+f(y)\quad \forall x,y\in \mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(xy)=f(x)g(y)+f(y)$

If $f(0)=0$, then $P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $f(x)=0$ $\forall x$, impossible since $f(x)$ is strictly increasing. So $f(0)=\ne 0$
Let $a=\frac 1{f(0)}$

$P(0,x)$ $\implies$ $g(x)=1-af(x)$ and functional equation becomes :
$g(x)$ strictly monotonous and $g(0)=0$ and new assertion $Q(x,y)$ : $g(xy)=g(x)g(y)$
And so very classicaly $g(x)=\text{sign}(x)|x|^v$ $\forall x$ and for any $v>0$

And so $\boxed{(f(x),g(x))=\left(u(\text{sign}(x)|x|^v-1),\text{sign}(x)|x|^v\right)}$ $\forall x$ which indeed is a solution, whatever are $u,v>0$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Determine all functions $f:Z - Z$ where $Z$ is the set of integers, such that 

$f(m+f(f(n)))=-f(f(m+1))-n$ for all integers $m$ and $n$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+f(f(y)))=-f(f(x+1))-y$
$f(x)$ is bijective

$P(0,y)$ $\implies$ $f(f(f(y)))=a-y$ for some $a=-f(f(1))$
Using surjectivity, let $u$ such that $f(f(u+1))=0$ : $P(u,f(y))$ $\implies$  $f(u+a-y)=-f(y)$

So $P(x,y)$ may be written $f(x+f(f(y)))=f(u+a-f(x+1))-y$ and so $P(x,0)$ becomes $f(x+f(f(0)))=f(u+a-f(x+1))$

Then, injectivity implies $f(x)=c-x$ for some $c$ and, plugging this back in original equation, we get $c=-1$

Hence the unique solution $\boxed{f(x)=-x-1}$

	$\overline{abc}$ is a three digit number, the roots of the polynomial $ ax^2 + bx +c $  are integers, and these integer roots divide the $3$-digit number $\overline{abc}$. How many different $\overline{abc}$ can you find?
	\flushright \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/q1h581335}{(Link to AoPS)}

	\begin{tcolorbox}$\overline{abc}$ is a three digit number, the roots of the polynomial $ ax^2 + bx +c $  are integers, and these integer roots divide the $3$-digit number $\overline{abc}$. How many different $\overline{abc}$ can you find?\end{tcolorbox}
So quadratic is $px^2+p(m+n)x+pmn$ where $-m,-n$ are the two negative integers root.

Constraints are $p(m+n),pmn\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ and $m|10p(n+10)$ and $n|10p(m+10)$
WLOG $m\ge n$

First constraint gives very few values $(m,n,p)$ : 
$(9,1,1),(8,1,1),(7,1,1),(6,1,1),(5,1,1)$,
$(4,2,1),(4,1,1)$,
$(3,3,1),(3,2,1),(3,1,1),(3,1,2)$,
$(2,2,1),(2,2,2),(2,1,1)(2,1,2),(2,1,3)$,
$(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4)$

Second constraint reduces this short list to :
$(5,1,1),(4,2,1),(3,2,1),(2,2,1),(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,2,2),(2,1,3)$

And so $\boxed{\overline{abc}\in\{165,168,156,144,121,242,363,484,132,264,288,396\}}$
