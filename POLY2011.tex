	\begin{tcolorbox}i) Find all infinite arithmetic progressions formed with positive integers such that there exists a number $N \in \mathbb{N}$, such that for any prime $p$, $p > N$, 
the $p$-th term of the progression is also prime.
\end{tcolorbox}
Answer $p,p,...$ or $1,2,...$, here $p$ is a prime.
Assume that $a,a+d,a+2d,...$ is that arithmetic progressions, here $a\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$.

If $d=0$ we have $p,p,...$.

If $d\geq 1$. we will prove that $a=d=1$. If $a>1$, assume that $q$ is a prime such that $q|a$, then we have infinite primes $P$ such that $P\equiv 1\pmod{q}$ and $a+(P-1)d\equiv 0\pmod{q}$, contradiction, so $a=1$. If $d>1$, assume that $q$ is a prime such that $d\not\equiv 1\pmod{q}$ and $\gcd (d,q)=1$. Choose $k\in\mathbb{N}$ satisfy $kd\equiv-1\pmod{q}$. Then because $\gcd (k+1,q)=1$ therefore we have infinite primes $P$ such that $P\equiv k+1\pmod{q}$, now $1+(P-1)d\equiv 1+kd\equiv 0\pmod{q}$, contradiction.

And we're done.

	Here is a proof using Dirichlet's theorem... the difficulty of this problem depends only on the possibility to use it.

Obviously if $f(x) = x$, then f is ok.
Suppose $f \neq x$. Take some prime $p > N$ such that $f(p) = q \neq p$ and q is prime. Then p,q are coprime, and by Dirichlet's theorem, there exists a prime $p'$ such that $p' \equiv p \pmod q$. But then $q | f(p')$, this forces $f(p') =q$. Always by Dirichlet's, we can take infinity primes like p', and we have $f(p') = q$ at infinite points, what forces $f$ to be constant.

Therefore the only solutions are $f(x) = x$, $f(x) = c$ where c is prime, of course.

	$i)$ Suppose $nth$ term be $T_n=a+r(n-1)$ now $T_p$ is prime for a prime $p$ now define a sequence $p_n$ by $p_n=T_{p_{n-1}}$ and $p_0=$ , easy induction gives $p_n=(a-r)\frac {r^n-1}{r-1}+pr^n$ now if $a=1$ then $T_n=n$ otherwise take $p>N,r$ and then $p|p_{p-1}$ a contra. So $T_n=n$ is only solution.
$ii)$ First I'll show set of prime divisors of $|f(n)|$ is infinite. To show $f$ has infinitely many prime divisors let max number of prime divisors of $f$ is $k$ and for $f(n)$.Let $f(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{x_i}$ consider the numbers $f(n+\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{x_i+r}=m_r)$ for all $r\in\mathbb N$ So clearly $\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{x_i+r}|f(m_r)-\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{x_i}$. Now obviously $f(m)$ also shares same prime divisors. Now letting $P(m)=\prod p_i^{y_i}$ we must have now $min(x_i,y_i)> x_i$ absurd so they must be equal.Hence $f(m_r)$ is constant for all $r\in\mathbb N$ which implies $f(x)$ is constant. Now if $f(0)=0$ then taking $f(x)=xg(x)$ we get $g(x)=\pm 1$ for infinitely many prime $x$ and that implies $f(x)=\pm x$ for all $x$. Now for other case take prime $p>N,q$ such that $(q,f(0))=1$ and $q|f(n)\implies f(n+qk)$ now so by dirichlet there are infinitely many prime $p'$ such that $q|f(p')$ now also $q|f(p)$ but as $|f(p)|$ is prime so $f(p)=\pm q$ but it's absurd.So $f(x)=\pmx$ or constant.

	[hide="A Complete Solution"]
Let $\omega=$ a primitive fifth root of unity, then the five equation that result from plugging in $\omega^k$ for $x$ for $k=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ are
\begin{align}
P(1)+\omega Q(1)+\omega^2 R(1)&=0 \\
P(1)+\omega^2 Q(1)+\omega^4 R(1)&=0\\
P(1)+\omega^3 Q(1)+\omega R(1)&=0\\
P(1)+\omega^4 Q(1)+\omega^3 R(1)&=0\\
P(1)+ Q(1)+ R(1)&=5S(1).
\end{align}
Adding all the equations yields $P(1)=S(1)\implies P(1)=\frac{Q(1)+R(1)}4$.

$(1)-(2)+(4)-(3)$ yields $Q(1)=R(1)=b$.  Let $P(1)=a$ then from the first two equations we have
$(\omega-\omega^4)b=0$.  Since $\omega-\omega^4\neq 0$, we have $b=Q(1)=R(1)=0$ so $P(1)=0$ which means $x-1$ is a factor of $P(1)$ as desired.

	Here's a faster solution. Let $\omega$ be a primitive $5$th root of unity, and observe that for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, $P(1)+\omega^xQ(1)+\omega^{2x}R(1) = 0$. Hence $\omega, \omega^2, \omega^3$, and $\omega^4$ are roots of the quadratic equation $P(1)+xQ(1)+x^2R(1)$. A quadratic null at 3 different places must be null everywhere, implying $R(1)=Q(1)=P(1)=0$, so we're done.

$\cos 7x=64\cos^7x-112\cos^5x+56\cos^3x-7\cos x$ and so 

$\cos(7x)+1=(\cos x+1)(8\cos^3x-4\cos^2x-4\cos x+1)^2$

And since $\sin\frac{\pi}{14}=\cos\frac{3\pi}7$ and $\sin\frac{5\pi}{14}=\cos\frac{\pi}7$ and $\sin\frac{-3\pi}{14}=\cos\frac{5\pi}7$, we got the answer :

Consider the polynomial $Q(x)=x^3P(x)-1$ : it has degree $2014$ and $Q(k)=0$ for $k=1,2,3,...,2014$

So $Q(x)=a(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2014)$

If $\exists a<b$ such that $(a,b)\in A$, then $f(x+2\pi)-f(x)=c$ $\forall x\in(a,b)$ and so $\forall x\in\mathbb R$ and $f(x)=ux+v$ for some $u,v$
If $\exists a<b$ such that $(a,b)\in B$, then $f(x+2\pi)+f(x)=c$ $\forall x\in(a,b)$ and so $\forall x\in\mathbb R$ and $f(x)=w$ for some $w$

If none of these two conditions is true, then both set are dense in $\mathbb R$.
Choosing then any $x\in\mathbb R$, we can choose a sequence $a_n$ of elements of $A$ whose limit is $x$ and a sequence $b_n$ of elements of $B$ whose limit is $x$ and so :
$f(a_n+2\pi)-f(a_n)=2\pi u_n$ with $u_n\in\mathbb Z$
$f(b_n+2\pi)+f(b_n)=\pi + 2\pi v_n$ with $v_n\in\mathbb Z$

Taking then limits when $n\to +\infty$ (limits exist since RHS are continuous), we get :
$f(x+2\pi)-f(x)=2\pi u(x)$ with $u(x)\in\mathbb Z$
$f(x+2\pi)+f(x)=\pi + 2\pi v(x)$ with $v(x)\in\mathbb Z$
Subtracting these two lines, we get $\frac{2f(x)-\pi}{2\pi}\in\mathbb Z$ $\forall x$ and so $f(x)=w$ for some $w$

Hence, in all cases, we got $f(x)=ax+b$
Plugging this in original equation, we get $\sin(ax+b)=a.\sin x + b$
$x=0$ $\implies$ $\sin b =b$ and so $b=0$ and so $\sin ax=a.\sin x$ and so $a=0$ or $|a|=1$

Hence the three solutions (easy to check they are indeed solutions) :
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=x$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=-x$ $\forall x$

	[hide="Hint?"]Let $ \sin{x}$ be $ y$ and $ \cos{x}$ be $ \sqrt{1-y^2}$

Now, we need to find a polynomial with $ P(y+\sqrt{1-y^2})=P(y)+P(\sqrt{1-y^2})$

	Let $P\left(  x\right)  =x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{n}.$ If $t=\tan\frac
{x}{2},$ then $\sin x=\frac{2t}{1+t^{2}}$ and $\cos x=\frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}
}.$

It follows that
\[
P\left(  \frac{2t+1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}\right)  =P\left(  \frac{2t}{1+t^{2}
}\right)  +P\left(  \frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}\right)  .
\]


Multiplying with $\left(  1+t^{2}\right)  ^{n}$ yields
\[
\left(  2t+1-t^{2}\right)  ^{n}+a_{1}\left(  2t+1-t^{2}\right)  \left(
1+t^{2}\right)  +\ldots+a_{n}\left(  1+t^{2}\right)  ^{n}=
\]


\[
=\left(  2t\right)  ^{n}+a_{1}\left(  2t\right)  ^{n-1}\left(  1+t^{2}\right)
+\ldots+a_{n}\left(  1+t^{2}\right)  ^{n}+

1+t^{2}\right)  +\ldots+a_{n}\left(  1+t^{2}\right)  ^{n}.
\]


This is a polynomial equality which holds for any real $t,$ hence for any complex $t$ as well. Plugging $t=i$ yields
\[
\left(  2i+2\right)  ^{n}=\left(  2i\right)  ^{n}+2^{n},
\]
or
\[
\left(  i+1\right)  ^{n}=i^{n}+1.

Taking absolute values in both sides gives $n=1.$ Finally, we obtain that

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all integral values of $m$ for which the polynomial $P(x)=x^3-mx^2-mx-(m^2+1)$ has an integral root.\end{tcolorbox}
So $n^3-mn^2-mn-(m^2+1)=0$ $\iff$ $m^2+m(n^2+n)-n^3+1=0$

Discriminant of this quadratic in $m$ must be a perfect square and so $(n^2+n)^2+4(n^3-1)=p^2$

$\iff$ $(n^2+3n-4)^2+24n-20=p^2$

If $n>1$, we get $n^2+3n-4>0$ and $24n-20>0$ and so $24n-20\ge 2(n^2+3n-4)+1$ and so $2n^2-18n+13\le 0$ and so $n\in[2,8]$ and so (seven tests) $n=2$ and $m\in\{1,7\}$

If $n\in\{-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1\}$, so (six tests) $n=1$ and $m\in\{-2,0\}$

If $n<-4$, we get $n^2+3n-4>0$ and $24n-20<0$ and so $20-24n\ge 2(n^2+3n-4)-1$ and so $2n^2+30n-29\le 0$ and so $n\in[-15,-5]$ and so (eleven tests) $n=-10$ and $m\in\{-77,-13\}$

Hence the answer : $\boxed{m\in\{-77,-13,-2,0,1,7\}}$

Let $P(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ and $Q(x)=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3$

$y_i=-\frac cd-\frac 1{x_i}$ and so :

$(y-y_1)(y-y_2)(y-y_3)=-\prod(-y-\frac cd-\frac 1{x_i})=-\frac 1dQ(-y-\frac cd)$

And so one requested equation is $a+b(-y-\frac cd)+c(-y-\frac cd)^2+d(-y-\frac cd)^3=0$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all the polynomials $f\in \mathbb{R}[X]$ such that 

\[f^2(x)=f(x^2),\ (\forall)x\in \mathbb{R}\]\end{tcolorbox}
If $f(x)$ has at least two terms, let $n>p$ the two highest degrees summands.
The two highest degree summands of $f(x^2)$ are then $a_nx^{2n}+a_px^{2p}$
The two highest degree summands of $f(x)^2$ are $a_n^2x^{2n}+2a_na_px^{n+p}$
So impossibility.

So $f(x)=ax^n$ and plugging this in equation, we get the solutions :
$f(x)=0$ $\forall x$
$f(x)=x^n$ $\forall x$, and for any non negative integer $n$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/93044}{nguyenhung}]
	It's clear that $f(x)=c$, $c=0$ or $c=1$, satisfy the condition

Now, we consider $f\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^n {{a_i}{x^i}} $, ${a_n} \ne 0$

Let $x_k$ is the non-zero coefficient such that $k<n$ is the greatest. Hence

$f\left( x \right) = {a_n}{x^n} + {a_k}{x^k} + ... + {a_0}$

From the condition, we have

${f^2}\left( x \right) = f\left( {{x^2}} \right)$

$ \Leftrightarrow a_n^2{x^{2n}} + 2{a_n}{a_k}{x^{n + k}} + ... = {a_n}{x^{2n}} + {a_k}{x^{2k}} + ...$

By identity polynomial, we infer

$a_n=1$

$2{a_n}{a_k}=0 \Leftrightarrow {a_k} = 0$, which is not true because our assumption is ${a_k} \ne 0$

Hence there's no non-zero coefficient except $a_n$

Then $f(x)=x^n$

Conclusion: $f(x)=0$, $f(x)=1$ or $f(x)=x^n$

If degree of $P(x)=0$, then we get the solution $P(x)=c$ for any $c\notin\mathbb Z$

If degree of $P(x)=1$, we get $P(x)=ax+b$ and the property is $\frac{n-b}a\in\mathbb Z$ $\forall n\in\mathbb Z$ and so $P(x)=\frac {x+m}n$ for any $m,n\in\mathbb Z$

If degree of $P>1$ :
$P(x)$ solution implies $-P(x)$ is also a solution.
Wlog say $\lim_{x\to+\infty}P(x)=+\infty$
We also have $\lim_{x\to+\infty}P'(x)=+\infty$

$\exists u$ such that $P'(x)>1$ (and so $P(x)$ is strictly increasing) $\forall x\ge u$

$\exists a\ge u$ such that $P(a)=n$

Considering that degree $>0$, let $P(x)=a\prod(x-r_k)^{n_k}\prod\left((x-z_k)(x-\overline{z_k})\right)^{m_k}$ where $r_k$ are the real roots and $z_k$ the complex roots.

$A=-\frac{P'(-1)}{P(-1)}=\sum\frac {n_k}{r_k+1}+\sum\left(\frac{m_k}{z_k+1}+\frac{m_k}{\overline{z_k}+1}\right)$

Suppose $|r_k|<1$ $\forall k$. Then $\sum\frac {n_k}{r_k+1}>\sum\frac{n_k}2$

Suppose $|z_k|<1$ $\forall k$. Then $\frac{1}{z_k+1}+\frac{1}{\overline{z_k}+1}-1=\frac {1-|z_k|^2}{|1+z_k)|^2}>0$ and so $\sum\left(\frac{m_k}{z_k+1}+\frac{m_k}{\overline{z_k}+1}\right)>\sum m_k$

And so $A>\sum\frac{n_k}2+\sum m_k=\frac{\text{degree}(P)}2$

So $|r|<1$ $\forall $ roots $r$ implies $-\frac{P'(-1)}{P(-1)}>\frac{\text{degree}(P)}2$

And so $-\frac{P'(-1)}{P(-1)}\le\frac{\text{degree}(P)}2$ implies at least one $|r|\ge 1$

$n^3u^4+(4x+a)n^2u^3+$ $(6x^2+3ax+b)nu^2+(4x^3+3ax^2+2bx+c)u-v=0$

And since this is a cubic in n whose three roots are $1,2,3$, it must be $u^4(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)$ $=u^4(n^3-6n^2+11n-6)$ and so :
$(4x+a)u^3=-6u^4$
$(6x^2+3ax+b)u^2=11u^4$
$(4x^3+3ax^2+2bx+c)u-v=-6u^4$

The first implies $u=-\frac {4x+a}6$
The second implies $6x^2+3ax+b=11\frac{16x^2+8ax+a^2}{36}$ and so $2x^2+ax+\frac{36b-11a^2}{20}=0$

This equation have two distinct roots (abscisses of $M_1$ and $M_4$) iff $3a^2>8b$ and the two $u$ values obtained are opposite.
It has a double root $x=-\frac a4$ if $3a^2=8b$ but then $u=0$, which we cant accept.
It has no root $3a^2<8b$
When we have two roots, the last equation gives the $v$ value.

\begin{bolded}Hence the answer \end{bolded}\end{underlined}:
Such a line exists iff $3a^2>8b$
Then the four abscisses of $M_1,M_2,M_3,M_4$ points are $-\frac a4+\frac n4\sqrt{\frac{3a^2-8b}5}$ where $n=-3,-1,1,3$

$ac$ odd implies $a,c$ odd and $\ne 0$
$\frac pq$ root with $\gcd(p,q)=1$ implies $q|a$ and $p|c$ and so $p,q$ odd

If the three roots are rational $\frac {p_1}{q_1},\frac {p_2}{q_2},\frac {p_3}{q_3}$ with $\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$ , then :

$\frac {p_1}{q_1}+\frac {p_2}{q_2}+\frac {p_3}{q_3}=-\frac ba$

$P(0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)=0$

Can't we just say that because there cannot be infinitely many solutions, the only solutions of the Polynomial P(x) should be 0 or 1. As for every root r there is root $r^2$.

Is this solution correct or should we take further cases like the fact that $(r-1)^2$ should also be a root??

	A quite ugly solution, hope someone will post a more beautiful one.

Observe that $P(x)=(x+1)^2$ is a solution.
Now lets take $F(x)=P(x-1)$.

The initial relation transforms in: $F^2(x+1)+F^2(x)+1=2\big(F(x+1)-x\big)^2$

Take $Q(x)=F(x)-x^2$, equivalent to $F(x)=Q(x)+x^2$

The relation becomes   $\big(Q(x+1)+(x+1)^2\big)^2+\big(Q(x)+x^2\big)^2+1=2\big(Q(x+1)+x^2+x+1\big)$

Open the brackets and you get:
$Q^2(x+1)+2(x+1)^2Q(x+1)+(x+1)^4+Q^2(x)+2x^2Q(x)+x^4+1=\newline\newline
=2Q^2(x+1)+4Q(x+1)(x^2+x+1)+2(x^2+x+1)^2$

We know that $2(x^2+x+1)^2=(x+1)^4+x^4+1$, so

$2(x+1)^2Q(x+1)+Q^2(x)+2x^2Q(x)=Q^2(x+1)+4Q(x+1)(x^2+x+1)$


[color=#FF0000]Edit: A easier way to proceed. Let $a$ be a solution of $Q$ then so is $a+1$. Then so is $a+2$ as a result $Q$ has infinitely many solutions so $Q$ is constant. As a result we get $Q(x)=0$[\/color]

let $n=$ degree of $P(x)$
$n=0$ $\implies$ $P(x)=c$ which is never a solution and so $n>0^$

The equation may be written $P(x)^2-P(x-1)^2=4xP(x)+1-2x^2$
degree of LHS is $2n-1$ and so $x^2$ summand in RHS cant be the highest degree summand (since even) and we have degree of RHS $=n+1$ and so $n=2$

So $P(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\ne 0$ and the equation $(P(x)-P(x-1))(P(x)+P(x-1))=4xP(x)+1-2x^2$ becomes :

$(2ax+b-a)(2ax^2+2(b-a)x+a-b+2c)=4ax^3+2(2b-1)x^2+4cx+1$
Identification of $x^3$ summands gives : $4a^2=4a$ and so $a=1$
Identification of $x^2$ summands gives : $6(b-1)=2(2b-1)$ and so $b=2$
Identification of $x$ summands gives : $2(2c-1)+2=4c$ and so OK
Identification of constant summands gives : $2c-1=1$ and so $c=1$

Hence the unique solution $\boxed{P(x)=x^2+2x+1}$

Let $x,y,z$ be the three supposed rational roots. we get  $x+y+z=2$ and $xy+yz+zx=-2$

$\implies$ $x+y=2-z$ and $xy=z^2-2z-2$

And it's easy to see that this equation has a unique integer solution $m=n=p=0$ (infinite descent looking at the equation  modulus $5$).

Here is a very ugly proof :)

Let $f(x)=x^{2n}+a\sum_{k=1}^{2n-1}x+1$

1) $f(x)$ has no real roots, or two distinct real roots $r,\frac 1r$, or a double real root $-1$ or $+1$
[hide="proof"]================= begin of proof about real roots of $f(x)$ ==================
Let $g(x)=(x-1)f(x)=x^{2n+1}+(a-1)x^{2n}-(a-1)x-1$

It's easy to see that $g"(x)$ has exactly one real zero and so $g'(x)$ has at most two real zeroes and $g(x)$ has at most three real zeroes (one of which is $1$).

So $f(x)$ has at most two real zeroes. 
If $r$ is a real zero of $f(x)$, we see that $r\ne 0$ and $\frac 1r$ is a zero too.

If $r=1$ is a root of $f(x)$, then $a=-\frac{2}{2n-1}$ and $1$ is a root of $f'(x)$ and so a double root of $f(x)$
If $r=-1$ is a root of $f(x)$, then $a=2$ and $-1$ is a root of $f'(x)$ and so a double root of $f(x)$

So $f(x)$ has :
either no real root
either two distinct real roots $r,\frac 1r$
either a double real root $-1$
either a double real root $+1$
Q.E.D
================== end of proof about real roots of $f(x)$ ===================[\/hide]


So, in order to show the required result, we just have to show that complex roots of $f(x)$ all have $|z|=1$ (since factorization in real coeff quadratics of the product of $(x-z_i)$ with $z_i$ beeing the complex roots  can only be achieved when grouping $z_i$ and $\overline {z_i}$).

2) all complex roots of $f(x)$ have their module $=1$
[hide="proof"]================= begin of proof about complex roots of $f(x)$ ==================
Suppose we got a non real complex root $z=re^{i\theta}$ of $f(x)$ with $r\ne 1$
$z$ is a complex root of $g(x)=(x-1)f(x)=x^{2n+1}+(a-1)x^{2n}-(a-1)x-1$
$z^{2n}\ne z$ and so we get 

$a-1=-\frac{z^{2n+1}-1}{z^{2n}-z}$

$a-1=-\frac{(z^{2n+1}-1)(\overline z^{2n}-\overline z)}{(z^{2n}-z)(\overline z^{2n}-\overline z)}$

And so $Im((z^{2n+1}-1)(\overline z^{2n}-\overline z)=0$

$Im(r^{4n}z-r^2z^{2n}-\overline z^{2n}+\overline z)=0$

$r^{4n+1}\sin\theta -r^{2n+2}\sin 2n\theta +r^{2n}\sin 2n\theta -r\sin \theta=0$

$(r^{4n}-1)\sin\theta =(r^{2n+1}-r^{2n-1})\sin 2n\theta$

Setting $r=e^u$ with $u\ne 0$, this may be written $\frac{\sinh 2nu}{\sinh u}=\frac{\sin 2n\theta}{\sin\theta}$

But it's easy to show that $\frac{\sinh 2nu}{\sinh u}>2n>\frac{\sin 2n\theta}{\sin\theta}$

And so this equality is impossible
And so all complex roots must have their module $=1$
Q.E.D
================== end of proof about complex roots of $f(x)$ ===================[\/hide]

Hence the result

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all polynomials $P(x)$ with odd degree such that 
\[P(x^{2}-2)=P^{2}(x)-2.\]\end{tcolorbox}
[incomplete work]

Setting $Q(x)=\frac 12P(2x)$, we get $Q(2x^2-1)=2Q^2(x)-1$ and it's easy to show that $Q(x)$ is odd and that $Q(x)\in[-1,+1]$ $\forall x\in[-1,+1]$

Setting then $Q(\cos x)=\cos f(x)$, we get the equation $\cos f(2x)=\cos 2f(x)$

And so one set of solutions may be obtained with for example $f(x)=ax$ and so $Q(\cos x)=\cos ax$.

Choosing $a=2n-1$ where $n\in\mathbb N$, this gives us $Q(x)=T_{2n-1}(x)$ where $T_n(x)$ are Chebyshev polynomials.

And so a set of solutions : $\boxed{P_n(x)=2T_{2n-1}(\frac x2)}$ :
$P_1(x)=x$
$P_2(x)=x^3-3x$
$P_3(x)=x^5-5x^3+5x$
$P_4(x)=x^7-7x^5+14x^3-7x$

The problem is that I skipped a lot of considerations and maybe there are a lot of other solutions ... .

	With a little modification from pco's results, I shall claim that
\[P_n(x) = 2T_n\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\]
is the only polynomial solution of degree $n>0$ to this functional equation.  Write
\[P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k\,.\]
It is easy to deduce that $a_k = 0$ if $k \not\equiv n \;(\mathrm{mod}\,2)$, and that $a_n=1$.  According to pco's, $P_n$'s do satisfy the equation.  We merely need to show the uniqueness.  (The exception is when $n=0$, where $P(x)=P_0(x)=2$ and $P(x) = -1$ are both solutions.)

Write $m:=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$.  From the condition, we get
\[LHS:=\sum_{k=0}^{m} a_{n-2k} \left(x^2-2\right)^{n-2k} = \left(\sum_{k=0}^m a_{n-2k} x^{n-2k}\right)^2-2=:RHS\,.\]
Knowing that $a_n=1$, we can find $a_{n-2}$ easily.  The term with degree $x^{2n-2}$ of $LHS$ is $-2\binom{n}{1}=-2n$.  For $RHS$, it is $2a_{n-2}$.  Thus, $a_{n-2}=-n$. 

Now, the coefficient of $x^{2n-4}$-term on $LHS$ is a function of $a_n$ and $a_{n-2}$.  On $RHS$, the coefficient is $2a_{n-4}+\mathrm{const}$, where $\mathrm{const}$ is a function of $a_n$ and $a_{n-2}$.  The uniqueness of $a_n$ and $a_{n-2}$ thus implies the uniqueness of $a_{n-4}$ (in fact, you should find $a_{n-4} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}$).  The same idea applies:
1) Provided $a_n$, $a_{n-2}$, $a_{n-4}$, $\ldots$, $a_{n-2(r-1)}$, the coefficient of $x^{2n-2r}$ on $LHS$ is a function of these known coefficients.
2) However, on $RHS$, the coefficient of $x^{n-2r}$ is $2a_{n-2r}$ plus a constant which is a function of other known coefficients.
Equating what are known from 1) and 2), we find that there is a unique $a_{n-2r}$.  The induction is complete, and hence, $P_n$ is the only working polynomial.

Set $x=\cos (t+\frac{\pi}3)$ with $t\in[-\frac{\pi}3,+\frac{2\pi}3]$ and the equation becomes $P(\cos (t+\frac{\pi}3))=P(\cos (t-\frac{\pi}3))$ which may be written :

$P(\frac{\cos t -\sqrt 3\sin t}2)=P(\frac{\cos t +\sqrt 3\sin t}2)$

Setting $A(x)=P(\frac x2)$ and $A(x+y\sqrt 3)=U(x,y)+\sqrt 3 V(x,y)$ where $U, V$ are polynomials with rational coefficients, we get that :

$U(\cos t,\sin t)+\sqrt 3 V(\cos t,\sin t)$ $=U(\cos t,-\sin t)+\sqrt 3 V(\cos t,-\sin t)$

Choosing infinitely many $t$ in the appropriate interval such that both $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ are rational numbers, we get :
$U(\cos t,\sin t)=U(\cos t,-\sin t)$
$V(\cos t,\sin t)=V(\cos t,-\sin t)$
And so, since polynomials : $U(x,y)=U(x,-y)$ and $V(x,y)=V(x,-y)$ $\forall x,y$

And so $A(x+y\sqrt 3)=A(x-y\sqrt 3)$ $\forall x,y$

And so $A(x)$ is constant and $\boxed{P(x)=c}$ constant too.

Smallest polynomial for $\sqrt[3]3$ is $P(x)=x^3-3$

Writing the equation $\sqrt{1 + x^2}(\sqrt{(1 + x)^3}-\sqrt{(1- x)^3}) = 2\sqrt{1 - x^2}-1$ and squaring, we get the equivalent statements:

$x\in[-1,-\frac{\sqrt 3}2]\cup[0,\frac{\sqrt 3}2]$ and 
$(1+x^2)(2+ 6x^2 -2\sqrt{(1 - x^2)^3}) = 5-4x^2 -4\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ 

Setting $\sqrt{1-x^2}=t$ or $x^2=1-t^2$, the second part becomes :
$(2-t^2)(8-6t^2 -2t^3) = 4t^2-4t+1$ 
$2t^5+6t^4-4t^3-24t^2+4t+15=0$

[hide="To show that $Q(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$"]
In $\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, $Q(x) = x^6+1 = \left(x^2+1\right)^3$.  Note that $x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_3$.  Thus, if $Q(x)=u(x) v(x)$, where $u$ and $v$ are nonconstant integral polynomials, then one of $u$ and $v$, say $u$, has to be quadratic.  Since $u(x) \equiv x^2+1 \;(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$, we see that $u(x) = x^2+3kx+1$ for some integer $k$.  Simply dividing $Q(x)$ by $x^2+3kx+1$, you will get the remainder
\[-3\left(81k^5-90k^3+18k^2+27k+10\right)x-9\left(9k^4-9k^2+2k+2\right)\,.\]
The term $81k^5-90k^3+18k^2+27k+10$ may never be zero, as it is congruent to $1$ modulo $3$.  Thus, the factorization $Q=uv$ is impossible.

This problem seems weird. And I'm not even sure about my solution; it might be wrong, but I'll post it anyway.

Let $p(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}= {{a_k x^{k}}}$ be such a polynomial. We know that $p(x)=(x-a)q(x) +p(a)$ where $\deg(q(x))=\deg(p(x))-1$, i.e. $q(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{b_k x^k}$. In our case we have $p(x)=(x-1)q(x) +p(1)=(x-1)q(x)+1$. For $x=0$ this becomes $a_0=-b_0 +1$ or $a_0 +b_0 =1$. Similarly when considering for $b$ we find $a_0=-2b_0 +2$ or $2b_0 +a_0=2$ and when considering for $c$ we get $a_0 =-3b_0 +3$ or $a_0 +3b_0 =3$.
The only solution for these three equations is $a_0=0$ and $b_0=1$.  Now since $p(d)=5$ from $p(x)=(x-d)q(x) +p(d)$ and letting $x=0$ we get $a_0 =-db_0 +5$. Since $a_0=0$ and $b_0 =1$ we find $d=5$. Similarly we find that $a_0 =-eb_0 +5$ or $e=5$. Hence $d=e=5$.

$y=\cos \frac{3\pi}8=\frac{\sqrt{2-\sqrt 2}}2$ $\implies$ $(2y)^2=2-\sqrt 2$ $\implies$ $((2y)^2-2)^2=2$

And so $\cos \frac{3\pi}8$ is also root of $16x^4-16x^2+2=0$

It remains to prove that $16x^4-16x^2+2=0$ is irreducible in $\mathbb Z[X]$ to conclude that this is the minimal degree polynomial in $\mathbb Z[X]$ whose one root is $\cos \frac{\pi}8$ and so that $P(x)|f(x)$ and so to get the result.

	We know that $x$ is a root of the polynomial $X^3-X+1$.
Find a polynomial with integer coefficients having the root $x^6$.
	\flushright \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h404447}{(Link to AoPS)}
\end{problem}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/31915}{Batominovski}]
	Let $y:=x^6$.  Note that $y=\left(x^3\right)^2=(x-1)^2=x^2-2x+1$.  Thus, by using $x^3=x-1$, we get \[y^3=(x-1)^6=\left((x-1)^3\right)^2=\left(x^3-3x^2+3x-1\right)^2=\left(-3x^2+4x-2\right)^2\,.\]  That is, \[y^3=9x^4-24x^3+28x^2-16x+4=37x^2-49x+28\,.\]  Also, \[y^2=(x-1)^4=x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1=7x^2-9x+5\,.\]  That is, \[y^3-5y^2-2y-1=\left(37x^2-49x+28\right)-5\left(7x^2-9x+5\right)-2\left(x^2-2x+1\right)-1=0\,.\]  Thus, $y$ is a root of $t^3-5t^2-2t-1$.

Question: may $y$ be a root of integral polynomials of degree less than $3$?  The answer is no.  Why is that?

Yes, it's easy to show  this polynomial is irreducible over Q. But how does it result from here
that $y$ cannot be a root of a polynomial with degree less than 3 with integer coefficients?

Because otherwise the two rational polynomials share a common root, hence the degree of their gcd is at least one. The gcd is obtained using Euclid's algorithm, so it is a polynomial with rational coefficients, as well. But this implies that the third degree polynomial factors in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$, which is a contradiction.

	Does there exist a polynomial $P(x)$ with degree $n>0$ such that $P^{(m)}(x)$ (which is the composition of $P$ with itself $m$ times, $m>1$) has all $mn$ roots $1,2,\ldots, mn$?

	\begin{tcolorbox}Does there exist a polynomial $P(x)$ with degree $n$: $P(P(...(x)...))$ ($m$ times, $m>1$) have all $mn$ roots :$1,2,...,mn$?\end{tcolorbox}
I suppose $n>0$ in order to have $1,2,...,mn$ defined.

Polynomial $P^{[m]}(x)$ has degree $n^m$ and so has $n^m$ real or complex roots.

The phrase "all $mn$ roots" implies $n^m=mn$ and the only solution to this equation with $n>0$ and $m>1$ is $m=n=2$

So we are looking for $a,b,c$ such that $a\ne 0$ and $a(ax^2+bx+c)^2+b(ax^2+bc+c)+c$ has roots $1,2,3,4$

And so the system :
$a(a+b+c)^2+b(a+b+c)+c=0$
$a(4a+2b+c)^2+b(4a+2b+c)+c=0$
$a(9a+3b+c)^2+b(9a+3b+c)+c=0$
$a(16a+4b+c)^2+b(16a+4b+c)+c=0$

I dont know all the roots of this system but choosing $b=-5a$ and $c=5a+\frac 52$, The four equations of this system all become :
$a^3-\frac{5a}4+\frac 52=0$
Which has a unique real root.

\begin{bolded}And so the answer \end{bolded}\end{underlined}:
Yes, at least one such polynomial exists :
We must have $m=n=2$ and the polynomial is $ax^2-5ax+5a+\frac 52$ where $a$ is the real root of equation $x^3-\frac{5x}4+\frac 52=0$

Btw, in what contest did you get this problem ?

I never said that the problem is too easy. I said that the given statement implies $m=n=2$ and that there is a solution for these values (and I gave it).

Now if you change the statement so that we can no longer conclude $m=n=2$, I require some precision :

Is the question you got in your contest (what contest, btw ?) :

a) : "does there exist $m>1,n\in\mathbb N$ and a polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb R[X]$ with degree $n$ such that $P^{[m]}(k)=0$ $\forall k\in\{1,2,...,mn\}$" ?

b) : "Given arbitrary $m>1,n\in\mathbb N$, does there exist a polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb R[X]$ with degree $n$ such that $P^{[m]}(k)=0$ $\forall k\in\{1,2,...,mn\}$" ?

c) : "Find all $m>1,n\in\mathbb N$ such that there exists a polynomial $P(x)\in\mathbb R[X]$ with degree $n$ such that $P^{[m]}(k)=0$ $\forall k\in\{1,2,...,mn\}$" ?

If the answer is $a)$, then I gave you a positive response.

Obviously there is solution for some $m>1,n>0$ (I proved that there is a solution for example for $m=n=2$)
Obviously there are no solution for some other values : for example $n=1$ and $m>1$ implies no solution.

So we can not answer to problem b without analysing each couple $m,n$

So it's in fact problem c :(

You should check you exam sheet (what contest, btw ?)

Let $A(x,y)$ be the assertion $P(x^n+y^n)=P(x)^n+P(y)^n$ where $n=2010$

$A(x,0)$ $\implies$ $P(x^n)=P(x)^n+P(0)^n$
$A(y,0)$ $\implies$ $P(y^n)=P(y)^n+P(0)^n$

Subtracting these two lines from $A(x,y)$, we get $P(x^n+y^n)=P(x^n)+P(y^n)-2P(0)^n$

And so $P(x+y)=P(x)+P(y)+a$ $\forall x,y\ge 0$ and for some $a\in\mathbb R$
And so $P(x+y)=P(x)+P(y)+a$ $\forall x,y$ and for some $a\in\mathbb R$
And so $P(x)-a$ is a continuous solution of Cauchy's equation.

So $P(x)=cx+a$ for some $a,b$ and, plugging in original equation, we get the solutions :

$P(x)=0$ $\forall x$

$P(x)=2^{-\frac 1{2009}}$ $\forall x$

$P(x)=x$ $\forall x$

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/31915}{Batominovski}]
	The problem is not very complicated.  If $x^5-kx^3+x^2-1$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Z}$, then it has either a linear factor or a quadratic factor.  If the former case is assumed, then $x=\pm 1$ is a root, and hence $k=1$.  Now, if the latter is true, we have that $x^2+ax \pm 1$ is a factor of $x^5-kx^3+x^2-1$.  Therefore, balancing the fourth-degree and the first-degree terms, we've got $x^5-kx^3+x^2-1 = \left(x^2+ax + 1\right)\left(x^3-ax^2 +ax-1\right)$ or $x^5-kx^3+x^2-1 = \left(x^2+ax-1\right)\left(x^3-ax^2+ax+1\right)$.  Now, equating the remaining two coefficients, you should get $k=1$ or $k=3$.

(Sorry my English is not good) [color=#FF0000][mod: language and math improved][\/color]\end{tcolorbox}
With this added "non constant" constraint : 
Let $A(x)=x^5-kx^3+x^2-1=P(x)Q(x)$ with $P,Q\in\mathbb Z[X]$ both non constant.

We can wlog consider that both $P,Q$ are monic polynomials.
Since requested polynomials are non constant, we get two cases :

1) degree of $P$ is $1$ and degree of $Q$ is $4$
Then $P(x)=x-a$ and $a$ is an integer root of $A(x)$ and so is $\pm 1$ and so $k=1$ and we indeed have 
$x^5-x^3+x^2-1=(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x+1)$

2) degree of $P$ is $2$ and degree of $Q$ is $3$
Then, looking at degree $4$ and $1$ summands, we can write :
$x^5-kx^3+x^2-1=(x^2+px+e)(x^3-px^2+px-e)$ where $e=\pm 1$
Identification of degree $2$ summands gives $p^2-ep-1-e=0$ and so $(e,p)\in\{(-1,0),(-1,-1),(+1,-1),(+1,2)\}$
Identification of degree $3$ summands gives then $k=p^2-p-e$ and so :
$(e,p,k)\in\{(-1,0,1),(-1,-1,3),(+1,-1,1),(+1,2,1)\}$

And so two solutions for $k$ :

$\boxed{k=1}$ and $x^5-x^3+x^2-1=(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x+1)$ $=(x+1)(x^4-x^3+x-1)$ $=(x^2-1)(x^3+1)$ $=(x^2-x+1)(x^3+x^2-x-1)$ $=(x^2+2x+1)(x^3-2x^2+2x-1)$

$\boxed{k=3}$ and $x^5-3x^3+x^2-1=(x^2-x-1)(x^3+x^2-x+1)$

Are you hurt that your obviously redundant and nowhere-going post was qualified as such? (Perhaps some ego issues lurking there.) And in spite of your trying to present it as legitimate math? After all that, you're complimenting yourself for being "a serious user"? Dude, Lady Gaga's and Madonna's combined egos are little-o of yours.

As for the "not clever" advice - of course it's not clever. For you. Because this way you "solved" the problem, patted yourself on the back, added some more to your "seriousness" and generally felt really great about yourself. For what reason? A formalism-based rubbish worth a 4th-grader.

For Christ's sake, NOT saying that the factorization has to be nontrivial is exactly the same as NOT saying that a polynomial equation has to be solved in $\mathbb{R}$. It's something that's regularly done and no one makes a fuss about it - except some very clever and very serious posters, indeed true pillars of this board, yearning for some extra points in their own eyes.

And, I will say, strongly so, having poor skills in a foreign language is no excuse to write "ponimials" and "coefetcents". These are most likely words that are, in a form or other, universally used, as neologisms. I do not believe that anybody thinks that would be the correct spelling in English (which, moreover, can also be easily checked on google or any online dictionary), but that it is a lackadaisical approach, in which words, formulae, restricting conditions are thrown randomly, hastily, with a lack of respect for the poster himself, and for the others whose help he is seeking.

Nope. It was started by pco who wanted to play on formalisms and presented what everyone knows is NOT an intended solution.

This board is NOT a doctoral thesis, is NOT a competition in language skills and spelling, and is NOT a college exam. Therefore the usual "loopholes" in wording and\/or conditions apply. And implying without saying that a non-trivial solution is required is but the most common one.

Then again, it's the reverend pco who I'm after... and that seems to be a no-no around here?

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find integer $a$ such that a polynomial $f(x)=x^5-ax-1$ can be factorized into the product of 2 polynomials with integer coefficients, positive degree. Then for such $a$, factorize $f(x)$.\end{tcolorbox}
Factorization in two polynomials $P,Q$ with positive degrees implies that leading coefficients both are $+1$ or both are $-1$. Wlog say both are $+1$.
We have two cases :

1) one has degree $1$ and the other has degree $4$. Wlog say $P(x)=x-n$ and so $n$ is an integer root of original polynomial, and so must be $+1$ or $-1$
$n=+1$ implies $a=0$ and $x^5-1=(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$
$n=-1$ implies $a=2$ and $x^5-2x-1=(x+1)(x^4-x^3+x^2-x-1)$

2) one has degree $2$ and the other has degree $3$ and so
$x^5-ax-1=(x^2+bx+c)(x^3+px^2+qx+r)$

Identification of constant summands gives $c=-r=\pm 1$ and we get $x^5-ax-1=(x^2+bx-r)(x^3+px^2+qx+r)$
Identification of $x^4$ summands gives $b=-p$ and we get $x^5-ax-1=(x^2-px-r)(x^3+px^2+qx+r)$
Identification of $x^3$ summands gives $q=p^2+r$ and we get $x^5-ax-1=(x^2-px-r)(x^3+px^2+(p^2+r)x+r)$
Identification of $x^2$ summands gives $p^3+2pr-r=0$ and so two possibilities :
 $r=+1$ and $p^3+2p-1=0$ and so no integer solution  for $p$
 $r=-1$ and $p^3-2p+1=0$ and so $p=1$ and we get $x^5-ax-1=(x^2-x+1)(x^3+x^2-1)$
Identification of $x$ summands gives then $a=-1$

Hence the answer :
$\boxed{a=-1}$ and $x^5+x-1=(x^2-x+1)(x^3+x^2-1)$

$\boxed{a=0}$ and $x^5-1=(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$

$\boxed{a=2}$ and $x^5-2x-1=(x+1)(x^4-x^3+x^2-x-1)$

I dont like this problem and, as some clever cool users in this forum suggest, I'll change it before solving.

Here is the funnier problem I choosed to solve :
"Find all polynomials $p(x),q(x)\in\mathbb R[X]$ such that $p(x)q(x+1)-p(x+1)q(x)=1$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R$"

Notice that if the equality is true for any $x\in\mathbb R$, it's also true for any $x\in\mathbb C$

We get :
$p(x)q(x+1)-p(x+1)q(x)=1$
$p(x-1)q(x)-p(x)q(x-1)=1$

And so, subtracting $p(x)(q(x-1)+q(x+1))=q(x)(p(x-1)+p(x+1))$

But no real or complex zero of $p(x)$ may be a zero of $q(x)$ else $p(x)q(x+1)-p(x+1)q(x)=1$ would be false.
So $p(x)|p(x-1)+p(x+1)$ and since they are two polynomials with same degree, we get :

$p(x+1)+p(x-1)=ap(x)$ (and same for $q(x)$ with same constant $a$).

Writing this as $\frac{p(x+1)}{p(x)}+\frac{p(x-1)}{p(x)}=a$ and setting $x\to+\infty$, we get $a=2$

So $p(x+1)-p(x)=p(x)-p(x-1)$ and so $p(x+1)-p(x)=b$ constant (since polynomials).

So $p(x)=bx+c$ and $q(x)=b'x+c'$

Plugging this in original equation, we get $cb'-bc'=1$

\begin{bolded}Hence the answer \end{bolded}\end{underlined}:
$p(x)=ax+b$
$q(x)=cx+d$
for any real $a,b,c,d$ such that $bc-ad=1$

It is probably truer to the intention of the proposer, and to the typical such problems, to take the equality $p(x)q(x+1)-p(x+1)q(x)=1$ as equality of \begin{bolded}polynomials\end{bolded} in $\mathbb R[X]$, rather than equality of\begin{bolded} polynomial functions \end{bolded}over $\mathbb R$.

Formally, this is wrong : choose $P(x)=1$ and sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,...=2,2,1,1,1,...$ as counter example.

The problem needs two modifications :
a) the relation $a_{n+1}=P(a_n)$ must be true $\forall n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ and not only $\forall n\in\mathbb N$
b) we must add the constraint $a_0\ne 0$ in order $\gcd(a_0,a_1)$ be defined.

The fact that $P(0)=P(1)=1$ implies then that $P(x)\ne 0$ $\forall x\in\mathbb Z$
And if $p|x$ and $p|P(x)=P(0)+xQ(x)$, then $p|P(0)=1$ and so, $\forall x\ne 0$ : $\gcd(x,P(x))=1$

Hence the result.

	I disagree, pco. If $a_0 = 0$, that clearly forces $a_n = 1$ for all $n\geq 1$ (the same as if we start with $a_0=1$). Why do you say $\gcd(a_0,a_1)$ would then be undefined? Only $\gcd(0,0)$ is undefined; for any positive integer $a \neq 0$ we have $\gcd(0,a) = a$, from definition.

(Also, it is strange from a guy from France that you insist $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,\ldots\}$. As far as I know, the Romanians adopted the French notation that $\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, and so denote $\mathbb{N}^* = \{1,2,\ldots\}$).

1) about "$a_0 = 0$ which clearly forces $a_n = 1$ for all $n\geq 1$" this was wrong in the first version of the problem since the equation $a_{n+1}=P(a_n)$ was only valid for $n\in\mathbb N$ and so $a_1$ was not deduced from $a_0$

2) about gcd definition, I looked at http://en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Greatest_common_divisor in which gcd seems to be defined only for non zero integers (although I agree with the fact that $\gcd(n,0)=n$ for $n\ne 0$ has full sense (maybe better to write $\gcd(0,n)=|n|$)

I understand and it's not a problem for me.
But then I wonder what is then the interest of the statement $P(1)=1$
It seems to be that $P(0)=1$ is enough to prove that $\gcd(x,P(x))=1$ and I used $P(1)=1$ only to prove that $a_n\ne 0$ $\forall n\ge 1$

	No, Patrick, all you did was prove that then $\gcd(a_n,a_{n+1}) = 1$ (you only work with consecutive terms). A simple counterexample is enough: take $P(x) = x+1$, so $P(0)=1$. Take $a_0=a\geq 0$. Then $a_n = a + n$, and clearly these values are not all pairwise coprime.

A correct proof uses both conditions $P(0)=1$ and $P(1)=1$. It follows then $P(x) = (x-1)xQ(x) + 1$, so $P(x)-1 = (x-1)xQ(x)$. Then by simple iteration we have $a_{n+1} - 1= P(a_n) -1 = (a_n - 1)a_nQ(a_n) = \cdots = (a_0-1)\prod_{k=0}^n a_kQ(a_k)$. RHS is divisible by all $a_k$, $0\leq k\leq n$, so LHS is, but $a_{n+1}$ is coprime with LHS.

If $p_k(x)=2\cos u$, then $p_{k+1}(x)=8\cos^3 u-6\cos u=2\cos 3u$ and so $p_k(2\cos u)=2\cos 3^{k-1}u$

Let $m=$ degree of $P(x)$. We know that degree of $P(P(P(x)))$ is $m^3$

If $A=0$ we get then $m^3=1$ and so $m=1$ and $P(x)=ax+b$ and we get $P(P(P(x)))=a^3x+b(a^2+a+1)=19x+99$ and so $P(x)=\sqrt[3]{19}x+\frac{99(\sqrt[3]{19}-1)}{18}$

If $A\ne 0$, we get then $m^3=n$ and, since $n\in[2,19]$, we get $m=2$ and $n=8$

So $P(x)=ax^2+bx+c$
The two highest degree summands of $P(P(x))$ are then $a^3x^4+2a^2bx^3$
The two highest degree summands of $P(P(P(x)))$ are then $a^7x^8+4a^6bx^7$ and so $b=0$
But then $P(x)$ is even, and so must be $P(P(P(x)))$, which is wrong.
So no solution if $A\ne 0$

	\begin{tcolorbox}For every natural number $n$, find all polynomials $x^2+ax+b$, where $a^2 \geq 4b$, that divide $x^{2n} + ax^n + b$.\end{tcolorbox}
Let the polynomial be $P(x)=(x-u)(x-v)$ so that $Q(x)=x^{2n}+ax^n+b=(x^n-u)(x^n-v)$

We need $(u^n-u)(u^n-v)=(v^n-u)(v^n-v)=0$ and rather simple casework :

$u=0$ and $v^n(v^n-v)=0$ and so $v\in\{0,1\}$
$u=1$ and $v^n(v^n-v)=0$ and so $v\in\{0,1\}$
$u\notin\{0,1\}$ and so $u^n=v$ and $(u^{n^2}-u)(u^{n^2}-u^n)=0$ and so $u=-1$ and $v=(-1)^n$

Hence the solutions (which indeed all are solutions) :
$x^2$
$x^2-x$
$x^2-2x+1$
$x^2+(1-(-1)^n)x-(-1)^n$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/64716}{mavropnevma}]
	For $n$ odd there are some forgotten cases, like $x^2 + x$, due to $u=-1$ also having to be considered. This also makes $x^2 - 1$ to work for all cases, not just $n$ even.

We need $(u^n-u)(u^n-v)=(v^n-u)(v^n-v)=0$ and rather simple casework :

$u=-1$ if $n$ odd and so $v\in\{-1,0,1\}$
$u=0$ and $v^n(v^n-v)=0$ and so $v\in\{0,1\}$ plus $v=-1$ if $n$ odd
$u=1$ and $(v^n-1)(v^n-v)=0$ and so $v\in\{-1,0,1\}$

	For each $t \in\mathbb{R}$, let $\Delta(t)$ be the difference between the largest and the smallest real root of $P_t(x)=x^3-12x+t$. Determine the set of values that $\Delta(t)$ may assume when $t$ varies.

	\begin{tcolorbox}For each $t \in\mathbb{R}$, let $\Delta(t)$ be the difference between the largest and the smallest real root of $P_t(x)=x^3-12x+t$. Determine the set of values that $\Delta(t)$ may assume when $t$ varies.\end{tcolorbox}
Notice that $\Delta(t)=\Delta(-t)\ge 0$ and so WLOG consider $t\le 0$

$P_t(x)$ is increasing on $(-\infty,-2)$ and reaches local maximum $t+16$ when $x=-2$
$P_t(x)$ is decreasing on $(-2,+2)$ and reaches local minimum $t-16$ when $x=+2$
$P_t(x)$ is increasing on $(+2,+\infty)$ 

$\Delta(t)=0$ is reached for infinitely many $t$ (those for which $P_t(x)$ has a unique real root). 
In order to have $\Delta(t)>0$ we need to have $t+16\ge 0\ge t-16$ and so $t\in[-16,0]$
Notice then that $P_t(-4)=t-16\le 0$ and $P_t(+4)=t+16\ge 0$ and so all roots are in $[-4,+4]$

Let then $x=4\cos u$ and the equation becomes $\cos 3u=-\frac t{16}\in[0,1]$

Let then $a=\frac 13\arccos(-\frac t{16})\in[0,\frac{\pi}6]$

The three roots are $4\cos a,4\cos a+\frac{2\pi}3,4\cos a+\frac{4\pi}3$ and $\Delta(t)=4\cos a-4\cos(a+\frac{2\pi}3)$ (remember $a=\in[0,\frac{\pi}6]$)

So $\Delta(t)=4\sqrt 3\sin(a+\frac{\pi}3)$

And so minimum value of $\Delta(t)$ is $6$ when $a=0$ (which occurs when $t=-16$)
And maximum value is $4\sqrt 3$ when $a=\frac{\pi}6$ (which occurs when $t=0$)

Hence the answer $\boxed{\Delta(\mathbb R)=\{0\}\cup[6,4\sqrt 3]}$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Here is my solution.\end{tcolorbox}
$\Delta(t)\ge 0$ by definition (the largest is $\ge$ the smallest)

$P_0(t)=x^3-12x=x(x^2-12)$ an so greatest root is $2\sqrt 3$ while smallest is $-2\sqrt 3$ and so $\Delta(0)=4\sqrt 3 > 4$

So range $[-4,+4]$ is obviously wrong. :oops:

	[hide="My solution"]

Clearly, $\Delta(t)=0$ for $t\geq 16 $ and $t\leq -16$, because in this case $P_t$ has only one real root.

When $P_t$ has three real roots, one of the roots is in the interval $[-2,2]$, because the roots of the derivative of $P_t$ are $2$ and $-2$.
In this case, let $\alpha\leq\beta\leq\gamma$ be the three roots of $P_t$. We have $-2\leq\beta\leq2$.
By Vieta's formulas, $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=0$ and $\alpha\beta+\beta\gamma+\gamma\alpha=-12$, which lead to $\alpha+\gamma=-\beta$ and $\alpha\gamma=\beta^2-12$.
Finally, note that $\Delta(t)^2=(\gamma-\alpha)^2=(\gamma+\alpha)^2-4\alpha\gamma=48-3\beta^2. \Rightarrow 6\leq\Delta(t)\leq4\sqrt{3}.$

The answer is $\{0\} \cup [6,4\sqrt{3}].$[\/hide]
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/3182}{Kunihiko_Chikaya}]
	That's nice solution, lucascolucci.

Let me say one thing, when $t=\pm 16$, the real roots are $x=-4, \ 2\ (double\ root)$ or $x=-2\ (double\ root),\ 4$.

Another Approach:

Let $\alpha $ be the real root, we have $\alpha ^3-12\alpha +t=0$, thus the given cubic equation can be written as 

$x^3-12x+12\alpha -\alpha ^ 3=0\Longleftrightarrow (x-\alpha)(x^2+\alpha x+\alpha ^ 2 -12)=0$, thus 

$\text{All roots of the equation are real}\Longleftrightarrow D=\alpha ^ 2-4(\alpha ^2-12)\geq 0\Longleftrightarrow -4\leq \alpha \leq 4$.

That's to say, we have real roots : $x=\alpha,\ \beta=\frac{-\alpha +\sqrt{3}\sqrt{16-\alpha ^ 2}}{2},\ \gamma=\frac{-\alpha -\sqrt{3}\sqrt{16-\alpha ^ 2}}{2}$.

Then from the attached graph in my previous post [url=http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=2477860#p2477860]see here[\/url], we can easily classify the following cases:

$1^\circ\ -4\leq \alpha\leq -2\ ;\ \Delta(t)=\gamma -\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(\sqrt{16-\alpha ^ 2}-\sqrt{3}\alpha)$

$2^\circ\ -2\leq \alpha \leq 2\ ;\ \Delta(t)=\beta-\gamma =\sqrt{3}\sqrt{16-\alpha ^ 2}$

$3^\circ\ 2\leq \alpha \leq 4\ ;\ \Delta(t)=\alpha -\gamma =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(\sqrt{16-\alpha ^ 2}+\sqrt{3}\alpha)$

Sketching these graph gives $\Delta (t)_{max}=4\sqrt{3}$ when $\alpha =\pm 2\sqrt{3},\ 0$ and $\Delta (t)_{min}=6$ when $\alpha =\pm 4,\ \pm 2$.

By the way, again back to the attached graph, couldln't we say that $\Delta(t)$ is maximized when $t=0$ by the graph?

Finally, when $P_t(x)=0$ has only one real root, the remain roots would have imaginary root (conjugate), $\Delta (t)=0$ sounds strange to Japanese.

	\begin{tcolorbox}...

$\Delta(t)$ is defined as the difference between the largest \begin{bolded}real \end{underlined}\end{bolded}root and the smallest \begin{bolded}real \end{underlined}\end{bolded}root. So when we have just one real root, the largest and the smallest are the same and $\Delta(t)=0$

	In fact $S =  \{ x \mid P(x) \neq 0  \}$, the set of all real numbers which are not roots of $P(x)$. The claim is trivial; since $P(x)$ has a real root $\rho$, for any $\varepsilon >0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|P(r)| < \varepsilon$ for all $r\in (\rho-\delta,\rho+\delta)$. Just take $|P(x)| = \varepsilon$ for any $x\in S$, and $a = r - x$ for such an $r$, with $r \neq x$ and $r$ different from any real root of $P(x)$ (which are finitely many).

If we replace "any $x\in S$" with "all $x\in S$", the claim is false, since $\inf  \{ |P(x)| \mid  x\in S \} = 0$.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29034}{newsun}]
	Here is detail..
Assume that $ P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}a_ix^i $   and $ a_0 \neq 0 $
Then $ P(0) = a_0 $ and from hypothesis we find that $ a_0 = 0 $ or $ a_0 =1 $.
1, If $ a_0 = 0 $ so $ P(x) = x^sg(x) $ with $ g(0) \neq 0 $ and $ k \in \mathbb{N}^* $
Thus, $ P(x)P(3x^2)3^sx^{3s} = P(3x^3+x)(3x^3+x)^s $
Therefore, $ g(0) = 0 $, this is a contradiction.
2, Hence,  $ a_0 =1 $
Assume that $ x_0 \neq 0 $ be the root of $ P(x) $. Then $ 3x_0^3 +x_0 $ is also a root but $ |3x_0^3 +x_0|=|x_0||3x_0^2+1| > |x_0| $.
This implies that $P(x)$ has ifininity roots, impossible!
In conclusion, This problem has no solution.

Firstly , to BoyosircuWem , I had assumed $Q(x)$ to be another polynomial.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all polynomial P(x) satisfy $P(x)P(3x^2)=P(3x^3+x)$\end{tcolorbox}
@newsun : you forgot that $P(x)$ might have only non real roots.

If degree of $P(x)$ is $n=0$, then we get immediately the two solutions $P(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and $P(x)=1$ $\forall x$

Let us from now look for solutions where degree of $P(x)$ is $n>0$ :
$x=0$ $\implies$ $P(0)\in\{0,1\}$
If $P(0)=0$, then $P(x)=x^pQ(x)$ with $p>0$ and $Q(0)\ne 0$ but then the equation becomes $3^px^{3p}Q(x)Q(3x^2)=x^p(3x^2+1)^pQ(3x^3+x)$
And so $3^px^{2p}Q(x)Q(3x^2)=(3x^2+1)^pQ(3x^3+x)$ a,d, setting $x=0$ : $Q(0)=0$, impossible
So $P(0)=1$

Let then $p$ be the smallest positive power whose coefficient is non zero in $P(x)$ : $P(x)=1+x^p\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty}a_ix^i$ with $a_0\ne 0$

And so :
$\left(1+x^p\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty}a_ix^i\right)$ $\left(1+3^px^{2p}\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty}a_i3^ix^{2i}\right)$ $=1+x^p(3x^2+1)^p\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty}a_ix^i(3x^2+1)^i$

If $p=1$, looking at degree of $x^2$ in the equality, we get $3a_0+a_1=a_1$ and so $a_0=0$, impossible
If $p=2$, looking at degree of $x^4$ in the equality, we get $9a_0+a_2=a_2+6a_0$ and so $a_0=0$, impossible
If $p>2$, looking at degree of $x^{p+2}$ in the equality, we get $a_2=a_2+3pa_0$ and so $a_0=0$, impossible

Hence the only two solutions :
$P(x)=0$ $\forall x$
$P(x)=1$ $\forall x$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find the the number of natural numbers $n$ in the interval $[1005,2010]$ for which the polynomial $1+x+x^2+x^3+ \cdots +x^{n-1}$ divides the polynomial $1+x^2+x^4+x^6+ \cdots +x^{2010}$.\end{tcolorbox}
Let $P_n(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x^i$ and $Q(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{1005}x^{2i}$

$\forall n>2$ : $P_n\left(e^{\frac{2i\pi}n}\right)=0$ and so we need $Q\left(e^{\frac{2i\pi}n}\right)=0$ and so $n|2012$

So the only possible value in $[1005,2010]$ could be $1006$ which unfortunaly is not a solution since $P_{1006}(-1)=0$ while $Q(-1)\ne 0$

\begin{bolded}So no such $n$\end{underlined}\end{bolded}

$P(-2)=-15$ and so $P(x)=-15+(x+2)Q_1(x)$
$P(-1)=1$ and so $Q_1(-1)=16$ and so $Q_1(x)=16+(x+1)Q_2(x)$ and $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)+(x+1)(x+2)Q_2(x)$
$P(0)=7$ and so $Q_2(0)=-5$ and so $Q_2(x)=-5+xQ_3(x)$ and $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)-5(x+1)(x+2)+x(x+1)(x+2)Q_3(x)$
$P(1)=9$ and so $Q_3(1)=1$ and so $Q_3(x)=1+(x-1)Q_4(x)$ and $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)-5(x+1)(x+2)$ $+x(x+1)(x+2)$ $+(x-1)x(x+1)(x+2)Q_4(x)$
$P(2)=13$ and so $Q_4(2)=0$ and so $Q_4(x)=(x-2)Q_5(x)$ and $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)-5(x+1)(x+2)$ $+x(x+1)(x+2)$ $+(x-2)(x-1)x(x+1)(x+2)Q_5(x)$
$P(3)=25$ and so $Q_5(3)=0$ and so $Q_5(x)=(x-3)Q_6(x)$

And so $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)-5(x+1)(x+2)$ $+x(x+1)(x+2)$ $+(x-3)(x-2)(x-1)x(x+1)(x+2)Q_6(x)$

And so smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{n=3}$ with $P(x)=-15+16(x+2)-5(x+1)(x+2)+x(x+1)(x+2)$ $=x^3-2x^2+3x+7$

And, btw, it's always quite funny to see somebody posting in "unsolved" category (which means he tried a lot but did not succeed) and using a title saying "easy"

Let $x=\frac{4\sqrt 7y+7}3$ and the equation becomes $4y^3-3y=\frac 1{2\sqrt 7}$

Hence the three solutions of this last equation : $\cos\frac{\arccos\left(\frac 1{2\sqrt 7}\right)+2k\pi}3$ where $k=0,1,2$

And the three solutions of the first equation : 

$\boxed{\left\{\frac{4\sqrt 7\cos\left(\frac{\arccos\left(\frac 1{2\sqrt 7}\right)+2k\pi}3\right)+7}3\right\}_{k\in\{0,1,2\}}}$ 

This is according to me a closed form, but I'll certainly never call this "nice roots" :?:
(and, btw, cubic root expression\begin{bolded} is\end{underlined}\end{bolded} a closed form)

Another solution, but still not nice :

Let $x=2+\sqrt 3y$ and the equation becomes $y^3-\frac 1{\sqrt 3}y^2-3y+\frac 1{3\sqrt 3}=0$ which may be written $\frac{3y-y^3}{1-3y^2}=\frac 1{3\sqrt 3}$

Setting $y=\tan z$, this becomes $\tan 3z=\frac 1{3\sqrt 3}$

Hence the three solutions of this last equation : $\tan\frac{\arctan\frac 1{3\sqrt 3}+k\pi}3$ where $k=0,1,2$

And the three solutions of the first equation (and these are indeed the very same than in my previous post ) :

$\boxed{\left\{2+\sqrt 3\tan\frac{\arctan\frac 1{3\sqrt 3}+k\pi}3\right\}_{k\in\{0,1,2\}}}$

Maybe you could now give us the nice closed form of these three roots ?

	Your last expression looks a bit nicer for me, in the sense that it uses lots of 3's. Interesting that your substitution makes all the 7's disappear...

\begin{tcolorbox}Maybe you could now give us the nice closed form of these three roots ?\end{tcolorbox}OK. I admit that it's more for beauty than for the art of problem solving. :D

The solutions of $x^{3}-7x^{2}+7x+7=0$ can be written, using not less than six more 7's, as \[{x=\dfrac{7\sqrt{7}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^7\tan \cfrac{ {(k+7j)\pi}}{   {7\cdot7}}}},\quad k=1,2,4.\]

Very impressive ! I wonder how one can find these expressions :?:

If you like $3$ and $7$ : the greatest root is $\boxed{\frac 73+\frac 23\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+...}}}}}$, not a closed form, though

Sonnhard.\end{tcolorbox}that is not a real number. :?: And I suppose the idea of "niceness" is somewhat subjective.

\begin{tcolorbox}the greatest root is $\boxed{\frac 73+\frac 23\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+...}}}}}$, not a closed form, though\end{tcolorbox}But it means that $x=\frac 73+\frac 23y$ where ${y=\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+3\times 7\sqrt[3]{7+...}}}}}$ which is a root of \[y^3-21y-7=0,\] and this has the three roots\[y=-\,\frac3{2\cos\frac{k\pi}7}-2,\quad k=2,4,8\] as can be easily checked. And so the original solutions can also be written simply as \[\boxed{x=1-\frac1{\cos\frac{k\pi}7},\quad k=2,4,8}\] or even simpler as  \[\boxed{x=\sqrt{7}\cot\frac{k\pi}7,\quad k=1,2,4}\] 

Moreover we have the identity \[{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{7}\tan\cfrac{{(k+7j)\pi}}{{7\cdot7}}} =  7\tan\frac{k\pi}7} \] which however boils down to \[{{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{7}\tan(x+\cfrac{{j\pi}}{{7}}} ) =  7\tan7x}, \] which holds $\forall x\in\mathbb R$ and is much, much less impressive. :D

	I think the question obviously had to be "For how many INTEGERS $x$ can we have $P(x) = x$?"

The answer to this question: zero! Indeed, define $Q(X) = P(X) - X$. Then $Q(3) = 1$ and $Q(4) = -1$, which shows that $Q(n) \equiv 1\pmod{2}$ for all integers $n$, and hence, $Q$ has no integer roots.

	Or we could use the fact that for any function f with integer coefficients $b-a \mid f(b)-f(a)$ thus $x-3\mid P(x)-P(3)=x-4$ and $x-4 \mid P(x)-P(4)=x-3$ which implies $|x-3| \leq |x-4|$ and $|x-4| \leq |x-3|$ so $|x-3|=|x-4|$ which only holds for $x=3.5$ but $x \in Z$ so no solutions.

Let $n$ be the degree of $P(x)$

We get $(P(x)-1)(P(\frac 1x)-1)=1$ and so $(P(x)-1)(x^nP(\frac 1x)-x^n)=x^n$

Since both $P(x)-1$ and $x^nP(\frac 1x)-x^n$ $\in\mathbb R[X]$, we get $P(x)-1=ax^p$ and so $p=n$.

Plugging $P(x)=ax^n+1$ in original equation, we get $a=\pm 1$ and so :

$\boxed{P(x)=\pm x^n+1}$ for any $n\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ which indeed is a solution
