	My solution to this one:
If $a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots, a_{k}$ are points of a periodic orbit of $P$ ($P(a_{i})=a_{i+1}$) we have \[a_{2}-a_{1}\mid a_{3}-a_{2}\mid \ldots\mid a_{1}-a_{k}\mid a_{2}-a_{1}\] So we have $|a_{i+1}-a_{i}|$ is a constant. But this is impossible for $k>2$. (Guess why)
So all periodic orbits are of degree $1$ or $2$.
If we have no $2$nd degree periodic orbit we are done ($P(x)=x$ has at most $n$ roots)
If we have two $2$nd degree orbits like $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, then we have \[a-c\mid b-d\mid a-c\] So we have $|a-c|=|b-d|$ and similarly $|a-d|=|b-c|$ which easily proves that $a+b=c+d$. If we have a $2$nd degree orbit like $(a,b)$ and a fixed point $t$ then similarly we would have $t+t=a+b$. So now let just $u=a+b$ then all periodic points are the roots of equation $x+P(x)=u$ which obviously has at most $n$ roots.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/1174}{darktreb}]
	My question: does this problem still hold over the reals? 

When I first saw it, I intuitively thought that the maximum possible cycle should be 2, because if you consider the graph of an arbitrary polynomial $f(x)$ of degree greater than 1, and the line $y = x$, then while you're iterating you're basically jumping from points on the function, to the line $y = x$, then back to the function, etc. So you're going around in a rectangular motion, and you either start diverging, start converging, or in the special case of an iteration of length 2, you create a perfect rectangle ($P(a) = b, P(b) = a$). Oh yeah and there's the case $P(a) = a$ as well, of course.

Since we are given a positive integer $k$, and the convergence case would require infinitely many iterations, my first instinct is that the problem still holds over real polynomials with real coefficients.

EDIT: Courtesy of Thomas Mildorf and Mathematica I see that it does not hold over all reals. Just pounding out the resulting polynomials from applying $P(P(x))$ for instance will give many distinct roots....
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/8980}{julien_santini}]
	Maybe we should exploit the fact that $P$ divides iterations of $P$. 
In the easiest case, $P^{(2)}=QP$, where $P^{(k)}=PoPo \dots oP$ ($k>1$ times). Now $P^{(2)}(t)=t=Q(t)P(t) \Rightarrow P(t)$ divides $t$. But also $P(t)=Q(P(t))t$, and t divides $P(t)$, meaning $|P(t)|=|t|$. Now we have at most $2n$ such $t$. How do you finish it for this case ?
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/18317}{Centy}]
	I feel slightly robbed by this question. For the case where the cycle length of $P(P\ldots P(x) \ldots ))$ is 3 or more, I quoted a famous problem out of from the USAMO in the 1970s, proved in Engel's Problem Solving.

I got nothing for quoting it whereas I would have got 3 for proving it.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/1598}{Arne}]
	I also think some contestants got a serious advantage here. The problem from the USAMO is really famous, and it's also well known that any fixed point of $P \circ P \circ \cdots \circ P$ must be a fixed point of $P \circ P$.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/8628}{bodom}]
	is this solution right?please read it and tell me :blush: because if it is then again this problem is not hard at all.if it's wrong then :blush:  :blush:  :blush: if $k=1$ it is obvious.if $k=2$
let's say that there are  $n+1$(if there are more it is even better) integers $x$ such that $P(P(x))=x$.let $a_{1}> a_{2}>... > a_{(}n+1 )$ be those $n+1$ integers.we clearly have$a_{i}-a_{(}i+1) \mid P(a_{i})-P(a_{(}i+1)) \mid P(P(a_{i}))-P(P(a_{(}i+1)))=a_{i}-a_{(}i+1)$so $| P(a_{i})-P(a_{(}i+1)) |=a_{i}-a_{(}i+1)$.adding this for all $i=1,2,...,n$ we get that $|P(a_{1})-P(a_{2})|+....+|P(a_{n})-P(a_{(}n+1))|=a_{1}-a_{(}n+1)= |P(a_{1})-P(_{(}n+1))|$.

but$|P(a_{1})-P(a_{2})|+....+|P(a_{n})-P(a_{(}n+1))| \ge |P(a_{1})-P(_{(}n+1))|$.since in the last one we have equality then all $|P(a_{i})-P(_{(}i+1))|$have the same sign.
1)$P(a_{i})-P(_{(}i+1))>0$ =>$P(a_{i})-a_{i}=k$ for all $i=1,2,..,n+1$ =>$P(x)-x-k=0$ for n+1 numbers but this is a contradiction since P's degree is n
2)$P(a_{i})-P(a_{(}i+1))<0$=>$P(x)+x-k=0$ for n+1 numbers and again contradiction.
if $k>2$ again we easily get in the same way that $| P(a_{i})-P(a_{i}+1) |=a_{i}-a_{i}+1$ and this is just case $k=2$ 
i can't find any mistakes.are there any?
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/651}{Pascual2005}]
	well in Fact it is not a "hard" problem if you are used to polinomials! Obviouslyiy you have integeer coefficients you must use $a-b|p(a)-p(b)$ and later analitic properties: in this case analitic properties didnt help sou you only needed the divisibility and inequalities and some classical facts ( a polinomial of degree $n$ has $n$ roots)

And finally the key idea was considering the numbers $p_{k+1}(x)-p_{k}(x)$ which was typical since their sum telescope to what we wanted!

I didnt like about this problem some thinks, for example its ancestors

[url]http://www.kalva.demon.co.uk\/usa\/usa74.html[\/url]

However, It  is not too bad if someone knewed that problem, it just told him there is no period of lenght 3, which I think many people thought whitout knowing it...

Edit: I didnt read whats before my post...

	indeed, the "ancestror" that pascual says is a very famous and wellknown usamo problem.

\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/285}{harazi}]
	What you forgot to say is that the problem appeared in a kind of romanian TST some very long time ago for k=2. And believe me, this case is not much more difficult than this problem.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/21129}{nik}]
	I think there is simpler solution.
x-y | P(x)-P(y)
But also P(x)-P(y) | Q(x)-Q(y)
so, if Q(x)=x and Q(y)=y,
x-y | P(x)-P(y)
P(x)-P(y) | x-y. Then everything is clear.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/8628}{bodom}]
	that's what i did.but after $|P(a_{i})-P(a_{j})|=|a_{i}-a_{j}|$ it's not so clear and you must see that ineq in order to conclude about the sign. 
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/21129}{nik}]
	It follows:
 If there are n+1 roots of Q(t) = t,  a1 < a2 < a3 <... < a(n+1)
then we must have :
 P(a1) < P(a2) <... < P(a(n+1)), 
or P(a1) > P(a2) > ... > P(a(n+1)), 
because if for some i<j<k P(a(i)), P(a(j)), P(a(k))  aren't sorted, we get contradiction. After this it's similar to another solutions.

I think it's easier than author's solution, and problem isn't hard.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/8628}{bodom}]
	to nik:what's your argument for that contradiction?
ps:indeed there are solutions much easier then the author's
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/21129}{nik}]
	Contradiction to |P(x)-P(y)|=|x-y|.
If we write it for a(i),a(j)   a(j),a(k) , a(i),a(k) , the sum of the fist two must be equal to the third one. It's possible only in the case they're sorted.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/2639}{Peter}]
	My main objection for this problem would be:\begin{tcolorbox}and it's also well known that any fixed point of $P \circ P \circ \cdots \circ P$ must be a fixed point of $P \circ P$.\end{tcolorbox}and this makes the problem really easy, showing independence of $k$. Moreover, it's rather easy to "guess" this, and state it accurately even if you didn't know the theorem. (which is kind of weak, but I'm sure it happens.)

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/1598}{Arne}]

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/4243}{ondrob}]
	I found this problem, maybe no easy, but certainly not hard. The only gun I was about to use was $x-y$ divide $P(x)-P(y)$. And it was quite straighforward with that... $x-y$ divide $|P(x)-P(y)|$ and it divide $Q(x)-Q(y)=x-y$ (when you suppose such $x,y$ for contradiction). so $|P(x)-P(y)|=|x-y|$ and you almost've got it :)

	2who: I don't know whether I understand what are you asking for, but for every $k$ and every $n$ you can find such a polynomial $P(x)$, that $Q(x)=P_{k}(x)=x$ for $n$ integer values of $x$, just take: $P(x)=x+x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-(n-1))$ and $x\in\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$

	For the sake of a contradiction let $t_1>t_2>\cdots>t_{n+1}$ be integers for which $Q(t)=t$.
Then $i_i-t_j \mid P(t_i)-P(t_j) \mid P(P(t_i))-P(P(t_j)) \cdots \mid P^k(t_i)-P^k(t_j)=t_i-t_j$
so $P(t_i)-P(t_j)=\pm(t_i-t_j)$
Now it is easy to show that either $P(t_i)-P(t_{i+1})=t_i-t_{i+1} \forall i=1,2,\cdots,n$ or $P(t_i)-P(t_{i+1})=t_{i+1}-t_i \forall i=1,2,\cdots,n$(For this we use the ordering we have assumed).

But both the system of equations yeild $P(t_i)=t_i \forall i=1,2,\cdots,n+1$ which contradicts the fact that $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$.

	let $a_1<a_2< .... < a_l $ be the fixed points of Q, and suppose $l\geq n+1$  and  $S=\lbrace a_i\/ \ i\in [|1,l|] \rbrace $
\[(\forall (i,j)) \  a_i-a_j|P(a_i)-P(a_j) and P(a_i)-P(a_j)|Q(a_i)-Q(a_j) \]
it follows that  $ (\forall (i,j)) \  |a_i-a_j|=|P(a_i)-P(a_j)| \Rightarrow (\forall (i,j)) \ |\frac{P(a_i)-P(a_j)}{a_i-a_j}|=1$
we can easily deduce that $ (\forall (i,j)) \ \frac{P(a_i)-P(a_j)}{a_i-a_j}=1 or  (\forall (i,j)) \ \frac{P(a_i)-P(a_j)}{a_i-a_j}=-1$
WLOG $ (\forall (i,j)) \ \frac{P(a_i)-P(a_j)}{a_i-a_j}=1$ then by the mean value theorem\end{underlined} \[ (\forall i\in [|1,l-1|])(\exists c\in ]a_i,a_{i+1}[)  \ P'(c)=1 \]
Thus the equation $P'(x)=1$ has $l-1\geq n$ solution.  but P' has degree n-1 . Hence we found a contradiction.
As a conclusion: Q has at most n fixed points

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/165750}{mathdebam}]
	Well I see a lot of "it is easy from here to prove this afterwards" kind of sentences which are not actually satisfying.Hence I am giving a solution with all the "dumb" steps and no step jumps. :p
Let the required fixed points of $Q$ be $a_1,a_2,..a_{n+1}$.
Now clearly $P(a_i)-P(a_j)|P^{k-1}(a_i)-P^{k-1}(a_j)$ as the polynomial is of integer coefficients.(note here $k \ge 2$)
But $P^{k-1}(a_i)-P^{k-1}(a_j)|P^{k}(a_i)-P^k(a_j)=a_i-a_j|P(a_i)-P(a_j).$
Hence $P(a_i)-P(a_j)=|a_i-a_j|$.Fine upto here.But then there are a lot of "ordering" and other arguments which I do not understand quite. :p
Hence let $P(a_i)-P(a_j)=a_i-a_j$ and $P(a_i)-P(a_k)=a_k-a_i$.Thus $P(a_k)-P(a_j)=2a_i-a_j-a_k$.Now WLOG let $P(a_j)-P(a_k)=a_j-a_k$We get $a_i=a_j$.Similarly the other case.Hence this case cannot happen.
So either $P(a_i)-P(a_j)=a_i-a_j$ or $P(_i)-P(a_j)=a_j-a_i$ for all $i,j$.
So either the polynomial $P(x)+x$or $P(x)-x$ is a constant polynomial.But that contradicts the lower bound of the degree of $P$. Thus done.
And yes it was a bit too easy for an $P5$ if I have not mistaken above. :p

Well, the average score on it was $1.183$. One has to go back to 1996 to find a P5 with lower average ($0.493$), with the averages for the P2 higher. 
If one goes forward, with the exceptions of P5 of 2010 ($0.930$) and P2 of 2011 ($0.652$), all other averages are again higher.

So the IMO community belies your feeling; in fact it was one of the most difficult P5\/P2 from the last twenty years!

	Actually scores may be really misleading and people loose marks due to strange claims which they make and do not prove.And also the fact that it had an idea or a lemma which was previously in some USAMO has made maximum contestant to prove by using that lemma and thus neglecting the easier way.Anyways I may have made a mistake as well as this concept of "easy" or "hard" is a very much relative one.

	Nice! :)

Suppose that the polynomial $Q(x)-x$ vanishes at $n+1$ distinct integer points $x_1<x_2<\dots<x_{n+1}$ and note that $x_i-x_j \mid P(x_i)-P(x_j)$ for all distinct $i$ and $j$. Observe that $$P(x_i)-P(x_j) \mid P^k(x_i)-P^k(x_j)=Q(x_i)-Q(x_j)=x_i-x_j$$ and it follows that $|P(x_i)-P(x_j)|=|x_i-x_j|$ for all $i$ and $j$. We obtain $$\sum_{i=1}^n |P(x_{i+1})-P(x_i)|=\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i+1}-x_i)=(x_{n+1}-x_1)=|P(x_{n+1})-P(x_1)|=|\sum_{i=1}^n (P(x_{i+1})-P(x_i))|$$ yielding that the numbers $(P(x_{i+1})-P(x_i))$ ($i=1,2,\dots, n+1$) have the same sign. Thus, $P(x_i)=x_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots, n+1$ or $P(x_i)=-x_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots, n+1$. This is false as each of the polynomials $P(x)+x$ and $P(x)-x$ has degree $n \ge 2$ so they cannot have $n+1$ roots.

\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/345008}{Kayak}]
	Please proofread my solution :help:
[hide=Solution] We first prove the case for $k =1,2$, then we show that all cases are exactly equivalent to this. Also, we overuse the fact $a-b | P(a) -P(b)$.

\begin{bolded}Claim-1\end{bolded}: The problem holds true for $k=1,2$.
[hide=Proof] $k=1$ is trivial, because $P(x)-x$ can't assume more than $Deg[P]$ roots. Now, for $k=2$, note that the integers satisfying $P(P(x)) = x$ can be either fipo (short for fixed point, $P(x) = x$), or twin (the integes satisfying $P(P(x)) = x$, but $x \neq P(x)$). 

If two distinct roots of $P(x)-x$ are integral, we claim no twin satisfies $P(P(x))$, which is [hide=indeed true.] Let the the two fipos be $P(f_1) = f_1$ and $P(f_2) = f_2$ with $f_1 \neq f_2$. Assume otherwise, such that $P(P(t)) = t$, $P(t) = \bar{t} \neq t$. Now, from the fact, we have $t-f_1 | P(t) - P(f_1) = \bar{t} - f_1 | P(\bar{t}) - P(f_1) = t-f_1$, so $t-f_1 = \pm {\bar{t} - f_1}$ (minus case is impossible) $ = f_1 - \bar{t} \Rightarrow t + \bar{t} = 2f_1$. Proceeding analogusly, we have $t + \bar{t} = 2f_2 \neq 2f_1 = 2f_1$, a contradiction. [\/hide], so all are fipos, so again applying FTA to $P(x)-x$, we're done.

So assume at most one fipo satisfies $P(P(x)) = x$ (so there must be atleast one twin satisfying it). We now prove that any integer satisfying the condition satisfies $P(x)+x = constant$, which is [hide=indeed true] Take the twins to be $t, \bar{t}$ such that $P(t) = \bar{t} \neq t$ and $P(\bar{t}) = t$, and any one other integer $x, y = P(x)$ such that $P(P(x)) = x$ (they might not be different)

Now note that applying the fact two times gives $t-x = \pm (\bar{t}-y)$. Assume for the sake of contradiction, $t-x = \bar{t} - y$, so $t - \bar{t} = x-y$. But applying the fact again, we get $\bar{t} -x = \pm(t - y)$.  Now, the positivie sign can't happen (otherwise it would imply $(t, \bar{t}) = (x,y)$), so $t - \bar{t} = y-x = \bar{t} - t \Rightarrow t = \bar{t} \Rightarrow \text{Contradiction}$. [\/hide] So, all "pairwise" sums $P(x)+x$ is constant, so applying FTA on $G(x) := P(x)+x-constant$, we prove the claim [\/hide]

\begin{bolded} Claim-2 \end{bolded}  The problem is equivalent to proving Claim-1
[hide=Proof] Let $Q_k(x)$ denote the $k$ fold iteration of $P$, e.g $Q_3(x) = P(P(P(x)))$.  We prove that $Q_k(x) = x \Rightarrow Q_2(x) = x$. For $0<j<k$. Let $d_i = Q_{i+1} - Q_{ i}$. Now, applying the fact $k$ times, we have $|d_j| = |d_i| := d $, for any $0 < i, j <k$, so the claim is obvious. [\/hide][\/hide]

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/277546}{realquarterb}]
	[hide=Sketch] So the idea here is to use the lemma $a-b|P(a)-P(b)$. A simple usage of this lemma gives us $|{P(a_{i+1})-P(a_{i})}|=|{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}|$. It follows that P(X)-X+C=0 for n+1 X, which is a contradiction by the degree of the polynomial. [\/hide]

$a$ is a real root of the equation $x^5 - x^3 + x-2 = 0$. Find $\lfloor a^6\rfloor$\end{tcolorbox}
Let $f(x)=x^5-x^3+x-2$

$a^5-a^3+a-2=0$ $\implies$ $a\ne 0$ and $a^6=a^4-a^2+2a=\frac{2-a}a+2a=-1+2(a+\frac 1a)$

$f'(x)=5x^4-3x^2+1=5\left(x^2-\frac 3{10}\right)^2+\frac{11}{20}>0$ and $f(x)$ is increasing
$f(1)<0$ and $f(2)>0$ and so $a\in(1,2)$ and so $a+\frac 1a\in(2,\frac 52)$ and so $a^6=-1+2(a+\frac 1a)\in(3,4)$

And so $\boxed{\left\lfloor a^6\right\rfloor=3}$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/124745}{Uzbekistan}]
	Easy.

$x^5-x^3+x=2\implies x^2(x^5-x^3+x)=2x^2\implies x^7-(x^5-x^3)=2x^2\implies x^7-(2-x)=2x^2\implies x^7+x=2x^2+2\implies x(x^6+1)=2(x^2+1)>2\cdot 2x\implies x^6+1>4\implies x^6>3$ 
and  $x^5+x=2+x^3\implies \frac{x^5+x}{x^3}=\frac{2+x^3}{x^3}=x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}\geq 2\implies \frac{2+x^3}{x^3}\geq 2\implies x^3\leq 2\implies x^6\leq 4$ 
Then $3<x^6<4\implies \boxed{\left\lfloor a^{6}\right\rfloor=3} $

So we are looking for polynomials $P(x)$ such that $x^5-1|P(x^2)-P(x)$

I suppose we consider only real roots.

	Replace $x$ with $-x$ to see that $f^2(x)-2f(x)=f^2(-x)-2f(-x)$.  That is, $(f(x)-f(-x))(f(x)+f(-x)-2)=0$.  So one of the polynomials $f(x)-f(-x)$ or $f(x)+f(-x)-2$ has an infinite number of roots, and is thus identically 0.  It can't be $f(x)-f(-x)$ because $f$ is bijective from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.  So that means that $f(x)+f(-x)-2=0$ for all $x$.  In particular, $f(0)=1$.  But letting $x=0$ in the original equation gives $f(0)=f^2(0)-2f(0)$ which means $1=1-2$ or $-1=1$, which is not true.  Therefore there are no such polynomials.

Unless $f^2(x)$ means $f(f(x))$ in which case the polynomial must have degree 2, but then it is still not bijective.  So there are no solutions either way you read the notation.

So $f^2(x)+2f(x)=f^2(-x)+2f(-x)$ and so $(f(x)-f(-x))(f(x)+f(-x)+2)=0$ and since $f(x)$ is injective, $f(x)+f(-x)+2=0$

So $f(x)+1$ is an odd polynomial and we can write $f(x)=xh(x^2)-1$ where $h(x)\in\mathbb R[X]$

Plugging this in original equation, we get $h(x^4)=h(x^2)^2$ and so (since polynomial) $h(x^2)=h(x)^2$

This is a very classical equation whose only polynomial solutions are $h(x)=0$ and $h(x)=x^n$ (with $n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$)

$h(x)=0$ implies $f(x)=-1$ which is not a solution

$h(x)=x^n$ implies $\boxed{f(x)=x^{2n+1}-1}$ which indeed is a solution

The two roots of $x^2-x+1$ are $e^{i\frac{\pi}3}$ and $e^{-i\frac{\pi}3}$

So we want : 
1) $e^{im\pi}-e^{i\frac{\pi}3+in\pi}$ $+e^{i\frac{2\pi}3+ip\pi}=0$
which implies  $(-1)^m-(-1)^ne^{i\frac{\pi}3}$ $+(-1)^pe^{i\frac{2\pi}3}=0$ and so $m\equiv n\equiv p\pmod 2$


2) $e^{-im\pi}-e^{-i\frac{\pi}3-in\pi}$ $+e^{-i\frac{2\pi}3-ip\pi}=0$
which implies  $(-1)^m-(-1)^ne^{-i\frac{\pi}3}$ $+(-1)^pe^{-i\frac{2\pi}3}=0$ and so again $m\equiv n\equiv p\pmod 2$

1) Replacing $x$ by $-x$ in second equation, we get $x^2(x^2+1)Q(x)=x^2(x^2+1)Q(-x)$ and so $Q(x)$ is even

2) Considering that $Q(x)$ is not constant (since $Q(x)=2$ $\forall x$ is not a solution) and so that degree of $Q(x)$ is $n>0$ and looking at second equation, we get degree of LHS is $2n$ while degree of RHS is $n+4$

Considering then the increasing sequence $x_0=u$ and $x_{n+1}=x_n^2+x_n+1$, we see that $f(x_n)=0$ $\forall x$ and so that $f(x)$ has infinitely many distinct real roots, which is impossible since $f(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.

	And to show that there exist such polynomials with even degree larger than $0$, it is enough to see that for $f(x) = x^2+1$, $g(x) = f(x+1)$, we have $f(x^2+x+1) = (x^2+1)((x+1)^2 + 1) = f(x)g(x)$.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/69901}{dinoboy}]
	First of all the condition $x > 0$ is useless.  It only introduces the complication that there are finitely many exceptions when we consider all real $x$.

First remark multiplying $g(x)$ by $-1$ does not change the result, nor does adding an integer to it (applying the same transformations on $f$ has the same result of not changing the truthfulness of the result). Furthermore, if we change $f(x), g(x)$ both into $f(x-a), g(x-a)$ for a real number $a$ the truthfulness is not changed.

Hence we shift $g$ to be symmetric about the origin and be of the form $g(x) = ax^2 + b$ for $a,b \ge 0$ and we can assume $f$ is a quadratic with positive leading coefficient which has no real roots. It follows for all sufficiently large $c$ a positive integer, we have $g(\pm \sqrt{(c-b)\/a})$ are integers and hence $f(\pm \sqrt{(c-b)\/a})$ are integers as well. Let $x_c = \sqrt{(c-b)\/a}$ and $y_c = f(x_c), z_c = f(-x_c)$ when $c$ is big enough. Let $f(x) = dx^2 + ex + f$. Remark that $z_n - y_n$ is always an integer.
But $z_n - y_n = 2ex_n$. Hence for all $x_n$, we need $2ex_n$ to be an integer. But this is obviously false unless $e \neq 0$ because $2ex_{n+1} - 2ex_n$ approaches $0$ as $n$ grows large, hence $e=0$.

Therefore we have reduced the problem to $g(x) = ax^2 + b, f(x) = dx^2 + f$. We need for all big enough integers $c$ that $\frac{d(c-b)}{a} + f$ is an integer. This means $\frac{d}{a}$ is an integer. Hence it suffices for $\frac{-db}{a} + f$ is an integer. By shifting $f(x)$ appropriately we can get it to equal $0$, as $f = (d\/a) \cdot b$. It follows $f(x) = g(x) \cdot (d\/a)$ where $d\/a$ is an integer, and hence we are done.

$P(x)$ is not a constant polynomial in order sentence "$P'$ divides $P$" being meaningful.

So $P(x)=(ax+b)P'(x)$ with $a\ne 0$ (looking at degrees of $P$ and $P'$) and so $\frac{P'}P=\frac 1{ax+b}$ for all $x$ but roots of $P$

This last equation implies $P=\alpha(x+c)^{\frac 1a}$

Hence the answer : $\boxed{P(x)=a(x+b)^n}$ for any $n\in\mathbb N$

@yugrey : your condition is necessary, but not sufficient. Choose for example $P(x)=x^2(x+1)^2$ which fits your requirements but $P'(x)=2x(x+1)(2x+1)$ does not divide $P(x)$

Since $P(x)>0$ $\forall x$, we can write $P(x)=(x-z_1)(x-\overline{z_1})(x-z_2)(x-\overline{z_2})$ for some $z_1,z_2\in\mathbb  C\setminus\mathbb R$

Writing then $P(x)=A(x)^2+B(x)^2$, we get :
$A(z_1)=\pm iB(z_1)$
$A(z_2)=\pm iB(z_2)$

Choosing for example $\pm=+1$ in both cases, we get $A(z_1)-iB(z_1)=A(z_2)-iB(z_2)=0$ and so $A(x)-iB(x)=k(x-z_1)(x-z_2)$

Let then $z_1=Re(z_1)+i Im(z_1)$ and $z_2=Re(z_2)+i Im(z_2)$ and we get :

So $A(x)=k(x-Re(z_1))(x-Re(z_2))-Im(z_1)Im(z_2)$
And $B(x)=-k(x-Re(z_1))Im(z_2)-k(x-Re(z_2))Im(z_1)$

Setting $k=1$, we indeed get 

$P(x)=((x-Re(z_1))(x-Re(z_2))-Im(z_1)Im(z_2))^2$ $+((x-Re(z_1))Im(z_2)+(x-Re(z_2))Im(z_1))^2$

It's easy to check back this equality by setting $x=z_1$ and $x=z_2$ (and so also $x=\overline{z_1}$ and $x=\overline{z_2}$) in it.
Hence the result

We can prove easily that both polynomials $m$ and $n$ (for what $p=m^2+n^2$ ) have same degree $s$ , where the degree of $p$ is $n=2s$ . A polynomial with real coefficients and odd degree has at least a real root. If a polynomial has real coefficients, then for any $z\in\mathbb C$ we have $p(z)=0\iff p(\overline z)=0$ . If $p(x)\ge 0$ for any $x\in\mathbb R$ , then each its real root (if exists) has even multiplicity. Thus can suppose w.l.o.g. $p(x)>0$ for any $x\in\mathbb R$ a.s.o.

\begin{bolded}Application\end{underlined}.\end{bolded} If $p\in\mathbb R[X]$ such that  for any $x\in\mathbb R$ we have $p(x)\ge 0$ , then for any matrix $A\in\mathbb M_n(\mathbb R)$ we have $\det p(A)\ge 0$ .

\begin{bolded}Proof\end{underlined}.\end{bolded} Indeed, from upper property get that exist $\{m.n\}\subset\mathbb R[X]$ so that $p=m^2+n^2$ . Hence and $p(A)=m^2(A)+n^2(A)$ . Since the matrices $m(A)$ , $n(A)$ are permutably, obtain that $p(A)=[m(A)+i\cdot n(A)]\cdot [m(A)-i\cdot n(A)]$ . Denote $U=m(A)+i\cdot n(A)$ , where $U\in\mathrm M_n(\mathbb R)$ . Observe that $\overline U=m(A)-i\cdot n(A)$ and $\det\overline U=\overline {\det U}$ . In conclusion, $p(A)=U\cdot\overline U$ and $\det p(A)=\det \left(U\cdot\overline U\right)=$ $\det U\cdot\det \overline U=$ $\det U\cdot\overline{\det U}=$ $|\det U|^2\ge 0$ , i.e. $\det p(A)\ge 0$ .

$P(x)=0$ $\forall x$ is a solution. Let us from now look only for non zero polynomials.

$P(x)=x^nP_1(x)$ for some $n\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ and $P_1(0)\ne 0$

The equation becomes then $P_1(x^2)=P_1^2(x)$ and so $P_1(x)$ is either odd, either even and so $P_1(x)$ is even (since $P_1(0)\ne 0$) and so $P_1(x)=P_2(x^2)$

The only constant solutions are $P(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and $P(x)=1$ $\forall x$. Let us from now look only for non constant polynomials.
$x\in\mathbb C$ root $\implies$ $x^2$ root too and so the only complex roots are $0$ or have modulus $1$.
$x\in\mathbb C$ root $\implies$ $(x-1)^2$ root too and so (see previous line) $(x-1)^2=0$ or $|x-1|=1$

So real roots can only be $0,1$ and non real roots are such that $|z|=|z-1|=1$ and so $z=e^{\pm i\frac{\pi}3}$ but then $(z-1)^2$ is no longer a root.

So $P(x)=ax^n(x-1)^m$  and, plugging back in original equation, we get $a=1$ and $m=n$

Hence the solutions :
$P(x)=0$ $\forall x$
$P(x)=x^n(x-1)^n$ $\forall x$ and for any integer $n\ge 0$

Then all real roots have an even multiplicity and we can write $P(x)=A(x)^2Q(x)$ where $Q(x)>0$ has no real root and so, looking at previous paragraphs, is sum of two squares.
And so is $P(x)$

	note that P(x,y)=P(2y,-2x)=....=p(16x,16y)        .....(1)

  also note that P(x,y) has no real roots. 
  
expand P(x,y) ,then we get all (i+j)=0 where i is power of x, j is power of y ,as P(x,y) is a polynomial then i>=0 ,j>=0  sow get i=j=0 

                               hence P(x,y)=c      ,  where c is a constant.

Setting $x\to x+y$ and $y\to x-y$ in functional equation, we get $P(2x,-2y)=P(x+y,x-y)=P(x,y)$ and so So $P(x,y)=P(\frac x{2^n},\frac y{(-2)^n})$

Setting $n\to +\infty$ in this equation and using continuity (since polynomial), we get $\boxed{P(x,y)=a}=P(0,0)$ which indeed is a solution

If $a=0$, then $f(f(x))-x=0$ $\iff$ $(b+1)((b-1)x+c)=0$ and $|A|\in\{0,1,+\infty\}$ and so $|A|\ne 3$
If $a\ne 0$ :

Let $B=\{x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f(x)=x\}$. $|B|\le 2$
Let $C=\{x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f(f(x))=x$ and $f(x)\ne x\}$. If $u\in C$, then $f(u)\ne u\in C$ and so $|C|$ is finite and even
$B\cap C=\emptyset$ and $B\cup C=A$ and so $|A|=|B|+|C|$

If $|C|=0$, then $|A|=|B|\le 2$
If $|C|\ne 0$, let $a,b=f(a)\ne a\in C$ : $f(a)-a=b-a$ and $f(b)-b=a-b$ and so $f(x)-x$ is a degree 2 polynomial and changes its sign over $\mathbb R$ and so $|B|=2$ and so $|A|$ is even

The sentence "the roots are ..." with exactly $n$ numbers means that all the roots are real numbers (maybe not distinct).
I suppose too that $a_n\ne 0$ although it's not clear in the problem sentence.

Let $k\in[0,n]$ such that $a_k\ne 0$ and $a_i=0$ $\forall 0\le i<k$ and so $P(x)=x^{k}Q(x)$ where $Q(x)=\sum_{i=k}^na_ix^{i-k}$

If $k=n$, this gives polynomial $a_nx^n$ which indeed is a solution.
If $k=n-1$, this gives the polynomial $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ and so the solutions $-x^n+ax^{n-1}$

If $n\ge k+2$, roots of $Q(x)$ are $a_{n-1},a_{n-2}^2,...,a_k^{n-k}$ and so $a_na_{n-1}a_{n-2}^2...a_k^{n-k}=(-1)^{n-k}a_k$
So $a_na_{n-1}a_{n-2}^2...a_{k+1}^{n-k-1}a_k^{n-k-1}=(-1)^{n-k}$ and $a_i=\pm 1$ $\forall i\in[k,n]$

So all remaining coefficients are $\pm 1$
So all remaining roots are $\pm 1$ and $Q(x)=\pm(x-1)^p(x+1)^q$ with $p+q=n-k\ge 2$ is a polynomial whose all coefficients are $\pm 1$

Looking at coefficient of $x^{p+q-1}$ we get $\pm(p-q)$ and so $p-q=\pm 1$ and :
either $Q(x)=\pm(x^2-1)^r(x-1)$ with $2r+1=n-k\ge 2$ and all coefficients are $\pm 1$
either $Q(x)=\pm(x^2-1)^r(x+1)$ with $2r+1=n-k\ge 2$ and all coefficients are $\pm 1$

$r\ge 1$ and looking then at coefficient of $x^{2r-2}$, we find $\pm r$ and so $r=1$ and we get $Q(x)=\pm(x^2-1)(x\pm 1)$
And so the only two solutions $x^3-x^2-x+1$ and $-x^3+x^2+x-1$

\begin{bolded}Synthesis of solutions\end{underlined} \end{bolded}:
$P(x)=ax^n$ for any $n\ge 1$
$P(x)=-x^n+ax^{n-1}$ for any $n\ge 1$
$P(x)=x^n-x^{n-1}-x^{n-2}+x^{n-3}$  for any $n\ge 3$
$P(x)=-x^n+x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}-x^{n-3}$  for any $n\ge 3$

	\begin{tcolorbox}$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at least $2$ with all of its coefficients positive. Find all functions $f:\mathbb R^+ \longrightarrow \mathbb R^+$ such that for all $x,y\in \mathbb R^+$

                                                                                  $f(f(x)+g(x)+2y)=f(x)+g(x)+2f(y)$\end{tcolorbox}

Let $P(x,y):f(f(x)+g(x)+2y)=f(x)+g(x)+2f(y)$.

We will show that for some $c>0$ and $M>0$, for all $x>M$ we have $f(x)+c=f(x+c)$.
[hide]Consider a positive number $a$. Clearly, as $g$ is unbounded, there is some $b$ such that $g(b)>f(a)+g(a)$, so $f(b)+g(b)>f(a)+g(a)$.
Comparing $P(a,y),P(b,y)$ and eliminating the term $2f(y)$ gives
$f(f(b)+g(b)+2y)-f(f(a)+g(a)+2y)=f(b)+g(b)-f(a)-g(a)$.
Thus, for $c=f(b)+g(b)-f(a)-g(a)>0$, we have $f(x)+c=f(x+c)$ for all sufficiently large $x>M$.[\/hide]

Let $d=g(x_0 +c)-g(x_0)$, for some $x_0 >M$.

We show that $f(r)+d=f(r+d)$ for all reals $r$.
[hide]$P(x_0+c,y):f(f(x_0+c)+g(x_0+c)+2y)=f(x_0+c)+g(x_0+c)+2f(y)$.
For $y>M$ this becomes $f(f(x_0)+g(x_0+c)+2y)=f(x_0)+g(x_0+c)+2f(y)$.
Subtracting from this $P(x_0,y)$ gives $f(f(x_0)+g(x_0+c)+2y)-f(f(x_0)+g(x_0)+2y))=g(x_0+c)-g(x_0)$.
Then $f(z+d)-f(z)=d$ for all sufficiently large $z>N$.
Now consider any positive real $r$. Choose $X$ large enough such that $f(X)+g(X)>g(X)>N$.
Comparing $P(X,r+d)$ and $P(X,r)$ gives $f(r)+d=f(r+d)$.[\/hide]

Since some interval $[k, \infty )$ is contained in $ \{ g(x+c)-g(x), x>M \}$, we have
$f(r)+d=f(r+d)$ for any $d \geq  k$.
Consider any $p>0$. Since $f(r+p)+k=f(r+p+k)=f(r)+p+k$, we obtain that $f(r+p)=f(r)+p$ for any $r,p>0$.
Thus $f(x)=x+a$ for some $a$. A quick check shows that $f(x)=x$ is the only solution.

My thoughts:
[hide]This solution is truly distasteful; it's a rehash of the solution for China TST 2011 Quiz 2 - D1 - P1.
[url]http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=398427[\/url]
It's a common trick to obtain $f(x+c)=f(x)+b$ for constants $c,b$ for all $x$ then spam it everywhere.
In this particular solution, the number inside the $f$ (in this case, it's $c$) is fudged using the polynomial $g$.[\/hide]

	Let $P(x,y)$ be the given assertion. Obviously, $h(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ is not a constant function,

Outline of my solution:
Take some $x, y$ such that $h(x)>h(z)$ and take $d=\frac{h(x)-h(z)}{2}$
Then, $P(x,y)$ and $P(z,y+d)$ imply $f(y+d)=f(y)+d$
So, the function $f(x)-x$ is periodic and hence bounded.
That is, $|f(x)-x|<M$ for some real $M$.

But, $f(y)-y=\frac{f(2y+h(x))-(2y+h(x))}{2}=\frac{f(4y+3h(x))-(4y+3h(x))}{4}$
$=\cdots =\frac{f(2^n y + (2^n - 1)h(x)) - (2^n y + (2^n - 1)h(x)) }{2^n}$
So, $|f(y)-y|<\frac{M}{2^n}$  for large $n$.
So, $f(y)=y$, done!

	This is a really nice problem! :)

\begin{tcolorbox}Let $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree at least $2$ with all of its coefficients positive. Find all functions $f:\mathbb R^+ \longrightarrow \mathbb R^+$ such that
\[f(f(x)+g(x)+2y)=f(x)+g(x)+2f(y) \quad \forall x,y\in \mathbb R^+.\]

\begin{italicized}Proposed by Mohammad Jafari\end{italicized}\end{tcolorbox}

Let $h(x) \overset{\text{def}}{:=} f(x)-x$, $p(x) \overset{\text{def}}{:=} x+g(x)$ and $t(x) \overset{\text{def}}{:=} h(x)+p(x)$ for all $x>0$; then we obtain $$h(h(x)+p(x)+2y)=2h(y)$$ for all $x,y>0$. Swap $x$ with a variable $z>0$; then $$h(h(x)+p(x)+2y)=h(h(z)+p(z)+2y)=2h(y)$$ for all $x,y,z>0$. Notice that if $h$ is injective, then $f(x)=-g(x)+c$ which is false since $g(x) \rightarrow \infty$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$ while $f(x)>0$ always holds. 

Pick $a,b$ with $t(a) \ne t(b)$ and set $c=|t(a)-t(b)|$ then for all $x>N=\min(t(a), t(b), 0)$ we have $h(x)=h(x+c)$. Now put $y=\varepsilon$ and $x$ to be large enough so that $g(x)>N$ (hence $t(x) \ge p(x)-x=g(x)>N$), and substitute $y$ with $\varepsilon+c$; then $f(c+\varepsilon)=f(\varepsilon)$. Thus, $h$ is periodic with period $c$; i.e. $h(x+c)=h(x)$ for all $x>0$.

Now notice that $h(x+c)+g(x+c)-h(x)-g(x)=g(x+c)-g(x)$ is a period of $h$, for all $x>0$. Thus, all points in an entire interval are periods of $h$ proving $h$ is the constant function. Clearly, $h(h(1)+p(1)+2)=2h(1)$ shows that $h \equiv 0$. Hence $f$ is the identity function and it clearly works! $\blacksquare$

	This factors partially as $(x)(x-1)(x^6+1)+15$.

If $x\le 0$ or $x\ge 1$, then $(x)(x-1)\ge 0$, and $x^6+1\ge 1$, so $(x)(x-1)(x^6+1)$ is nonnegative, and thus the polynomial is at least $15$.

I claim that for values in this range from $0$ to $1$, we also have no solution.

Note $1\le x^6+1\le 2$ then.

Also $0\ge x(x-1)\ge -1\/4$.

Thus, $x(x-1)(x^6+1)$ is then at most $2$ in magnitude, so it is at least $-2$, and the polynomial is at least $13>0$, so we are done.

	If $x<0,$ note that $x^8+(-x^7)+x^2+(-x)>0,$ so the polynomial cannot have any negative roots.
If $x\geq 0,$ then note that from AM-GM inequality we have:
$\left\{\begin{aligned}& \frac 78 x^8+\frac 18\geq x^7\\& x^2+\frac 14\geq x\end{aligned}\right\} ;$
Thus $\frac 78x^8-x^7+x^2-x+\frac 38>0;$ so again, the original polynomial cannot have any positive roots.

Can you prove your lemma please?
Thank you!
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/107451}{Learner94}]
	The lemma posted was slightly wrong. Here is my proof. 

If $z$ is a complex root of a monic polynomial $x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ with complex coefficients then $|z| \le M $ where \[M_1=1+\max\{\mid a_{n-1}\mid,\cdots,\mid a_0\mid\}\] \[M_2=\max\{1,\mid a_{n-1}\mid +\cdots+\mid a_0\mid\}\]
\[M=\min\{M_1,M_2\}\]


Proof : 

1) We will show $|z| \le M_1$. Let $\max\{\mid a_{n-1}\mid,\mid a_{n-1}\mid,\cdots,\mid a_0\mid\} = p $

Note that if $z$ is a root then 

$|z|^n = |a_{n-1} z^{n-1} +\ldots + a_0| \le |a_{n-1}| |z|^{n-1} + \ldots +|a_0| \le p (|z|^{n-1} + \ldots + 1) = p \left ( \frac{|z|^n - 1}{|z| - 1} \right ) $

So we get $ |z|^n  \le p \left ( \frac{|z|^n - 1}{|z| - 1} \right )$

which rewrites as $|z|^{n+1} \le |z|^n (p+1) - p < |z|^n (p+1)$; implying $|z| < p+1$, qed

2) we will show $|z| \le M_2$. This splits in two cases.

i) if $1 > |a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0|$, we have to show $|z| < 1$.

On the contrary assume that $|z| \ge 1$

Then we have 

$|z|^n = |a_{n-1} z^{n-1} +\ldots + a_0| \le |a_{n-1}| |z|^{n-1} + \ldots +|a_0| \le |z|^n (|a_{n-1}+ \ldots + |a_0| ) < |z|^n$, which is a contradiction.


ii) if $|a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0| \ge 1$, we will show $|z| \le |a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0| $. On the contrary assume that $|z| > |a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0|$. Note that this implies $|z| > |a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0| \ge 1$, so $|z| >1$

Then $|z|^n \le |a_{n-1}| |z|^{n-1} + \ldots +|a_0| < |z|^{n-1} (|a_{n-1}| + \ldots + |a_0| ) < |z|^{n}$, giving $|z|^n < |z|^{n}$, which contradicts our assumption that $|z| >1$, so we are done.

Just for "fun" (yugrey's solution is quite nicer) :

$x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15=$ $\frac{(128x^4-64x^3-16x^2-8x-9)^2+4(16x^2-11x+121)^2+60(x-49)^2+43055}{2^{14}}$ $>0$\end{tcolorbox}

How did you arrive at this?
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29428}{pco}]
	Write $x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15-(x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d)^2=P(x)$
Let us make degree of $P$ even and the smallest possible.

Cancelling $x^7$ in LHS implies $2a=1$ and so $a=-\frac 12$
Cancelling $x^6$ in LHS implies $a^2+2b=0$ and so $b=-\frac 18$
Cancelling $x^5$ in LHS implies $2c+2ab=0$ and so $c=-\frac 1{16}$
Cancelling $x^4$ in LHS is not clever since then $P(x)$ would be of odd degree and we want it always $>0$

So we got up to now :

$x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15=(x^4-\frac 12x^3-\frac 18x^2-\frac 1{16}x+d)^2$ $+x^4(-2d-\frac 5{64})+x^3(d-\frac 1{64})+x^2(\frac d4+1-\frac 1{256})+x(\frac d8-1)+(15-d^2)$

Let us then write 
$x^4(-2d-\frac 5{64})+x^3(d-\frac 1{64})+x^2(\frac d4+1-\frac 1{256})+x(\frac d8-1)+(15-d^2)$ $=u(x^2+vx+w)^2+Q(x)$ with $u>0$ and $Q(x)$ polynomial of degree $2$ or $0$

Identifying $x^4$ summands gives $u=-2d-\frac 5{64}$ and so $d<-\frac 5{128}$

Identifying $x^3$ summands gives $d-\frac 1{64}=2uv$ and so $v=-\frac{64d-1}{256d+10}$

And we get then $Q(x)=x^2(-uv^2-2uw+\frac d4+1-\frac 1{256})+x(-2uvw+\frac d8-1)+(15-d^2-uw^2)$

And we must choose $d,w$ such that :
$d<-\frac 5{128}$ (in order to have $u>0$)
Quadratic is always positive and so :
a) $-uv^2-2uw+\frac d4+1-\frac 1{256}>0$ and so $-\frac{v^2}2+\frac 1{2u}(\frac d4+1-\frac 1{256})>w$
b) Discriminant of quadratic is $<0$

My example is with $d=-\frac 9{128}$ (and so $u=\frac 1{16}$ and $v=-\frac {11}{16}$) and $w=\frac{121}{16}$ but many other combinaisons are possible

For example, with $d=-\frac 6{128}$ and $w=2$ we get 

$x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15=$ $\frac{5(128x^4-64x^3-16x^2-8x-6)^2+1280(x^2-2x+2)^2+11(80x-41)^2+1205009}{5\times 2^{14}}$

And a lot of other possibilities

	my solution:
clearly applying descartes rule above has no negative roots but can have positive roots. also 0 and 1 are not roots. So we consider cases 0<x<1 and x>1
for x>1 we  have x^8>x^7 and x^2>x,  using  these inequalities x^8-x^7 + x^2 -x +15>0 so no roots greater than 1.
for x<1, absolute value of x^8-x^7 is always lesser than 2, same for x^2-x,  so so x^8-x^7+x^2-x+15>0 once again.
hence proved

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29428}{pco}]
	If $c=0$, we get $P(x)=a$ constant, which indeed is a solution.

If $c\ne 0$, the equation implies $\frac {P'}{P}=c\frac{P''}{P'}$ for all $x$ where $P(x)P'(x)\ne 0$ and so $|P|=\alpha|P'|^c$ on any interval where $P(x)P'(x)\ne 0$

And so $P'(x)|P(x)|^{-\frac 1c}=\beta$ on any interval where $P(x)P'(x)\ne 0$

$c=1$ gives a non polynomial solution.

$c\notin\{0,1\}$ gives then $|P(x)|^{1-\frac 1c}=ux+v$ on any interval where $P(x)P'(x)\ne 0$

So $|P(x)|=(ux+v)^{\frac c{c-1}}$ on any interval where $P(x)P'(x)\ne 0$

And so, since polynomial, $\boxed{P(x)=a(x+b)^n}$ for any non non negative integer $n\ne 1$, which indeed is a solution (and than $c=\frac n{n-1}$)

(note that setting $a$ out of parenthesis avoid to add a $\pm$ in front of it)

Derivative is $5x^4-20x^3+90x^2-100x+55$ $=5(x^2-2x+3)^2+10(2x-1)^2>0$ and so exactly one real root for this equation.

$\implies$ $a+1=\frac 3{2-x}$ $\implies$ $a=\frac {x+1}{2-x}$ $\implies$ $(x+1)^5=2(2-x)^5$

	Try to actually read it first; I don't see anything that needs clearer explanation if you work a little.

First, pco finds the derivative. As it's always larger than 0, then the function is strictly increasing and hence only one real root exists.

Now, denoting $a = \sqrt[5]{2}$ for easier writing, pco changed the form of $x-2$ ($x$ being the given root) to a geometrical series which yields the equality. Performing a little algebra, an expression of $a$ in $x$ is found. Replacing back the value of $a$, taking the fifth power, and another algebra will yield back the original equation, hence $x$ is indeed a real root.

Finally, as we have shown that it only has one real root, the problem is solved.

I think that tenniskidperson3'hint may be used as a rather elementary solution :

First note that $\sqrt[3]2\in(\frac 54,\frac 43)$ and $\sqrt[3]3\in(\frac 43,\frac 32)$ and $\sqrt[3]5\in(\frac 32,2)$ and so $\sqrt[3]2+\sqrt[3]3+\sqrt[3]5\in(\frac{49}{12},\frac{29}6)$ $\subset (4,5)$ and so is not an integer.

Let $j=e^{\frac{2i\pi}3}$ 

Let $P(x)\in\mathbb Z[X]$
Consider $Q(y)=P(x-y)$ as a polynomial in $y$ whose all coefficients are in $\mathbb Z[x]$
So $Q(y)Q(jy)Q(j^2y)$ is a polynomial in $y^3$ whose all coefficients are in $\mathbb Z[x]$
So : if $P(x)$ is a monic polynomial $\in\mathbb Z[X]$, so is $R(x)=P(x-\sqrt[3]n)P(x-j\sqrt[3]n)P(x-j^2\sqrt[3]n)$

Let then $P(x)=x^3-2$ : $P(x)$ is a monic polynomial $\in\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\sqrt[3]2$ is a root of $P(x)$
Let then $P_1(x)=P(x-\sqrt[3]3)P(x-j\sqrt[3]3)P(x-j^2\sqrt[3]3)$ : $P_1(x)$ is a monic polynomial $\in\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\sqrt[3]2+\sqrt[3]3$ is a root of $P_1(x)$
Let then $P_2(x)=P_1(x-\sqrt[3]5)P_1(x-j\sqrt[3]5)P_1(x-j^2\sqrt[3]5)$ : $P_2(x)$ is a monic polynomial $\in\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\sqrt[3]2+\sqrt[3]3+\sqrt[3]5$ is a root of $P_2(x)$

So, if $\sqrt[3]2+\sqrt[3]3+\sqrt[3]5\in\mathbb Q$, then $\sqrt[3]2+\sqrt[3]3+\sqrt[3]5\in\mathbb Z$, which is wrong.
\end{solution}

A great idea!!!
I have some idea. One of them is quite same your proof, but I haven't solved it yet. Another is too long. But it can be generalized. Because your proof is only useful for monic polynominal.

	The situation is not as banal as it may seem. For example, if the equation were to be $(x+1)f(x)=xg(x+1)$, then the general solution would be $(f(x), g(x)) = (xp(x+1), xp(x))$, for an arbitrary polynomial $p(x)$.

Now, the polynomial $\varphi(x) = x^2 - x + 1$ is \begin{bolded}special\end{bolded}, since we have $x^2 + x + 1 = \varphi(x+1) = \varphi(-x)$. Our functional equation writes $\varphi(x+1)f(\varphi(x)) = \varphi(x)g(\varphi(x+1))$.
Since $\gcd(\varphi(x), \varphi(x+1)) = 1$, it follows $\varphi(x) \mid f(\varphi(x))$ and $\varphi(x+1) \mid g(\varphi(x+1))$, therefore $x\mid f(x)$ and $x \mid g(x)$, i.e. $f(x)=xf_0(x)$ and $g(x)=xg_0(x)$.

The equation now writes $f_0(\varphi(x)) = g_0(\varphi(x+1))$. So $f_0(\varphi(x)) = g_0(\varphi(-x))$, hence $f_0(\varphi(-x)) = g_0(\varphi(x))$, i.e. $f_0(\varphi(x+1)) = g_0(\varphi(x))$, and so $f_0(\varphi(x+2)) = g_0(\varphi(x+1)) = f_0(\varphi(x)$. This writes as $(f_0 \circ \varphi)(x+2) = (f_0 \circ \varphi)(x)$, leading to $f_0 \circ \varphi = C$ constant, hence $f_0 = C$ constant. Similarly $g_0 = C$, and so the solution to the equation is $f(x) = g(x) = Cx$.
\end{solution}

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all real polinomials f and g so that:

$(x^2+x+1)*f(x^2-x+1)=(x^2-x+1)*g(x^2+x+1)$

for all real x.\end{tcolorbox}
Another writing of the same method :
Let $z$ a complex root of $x^2-x+1=0$. Pluging $z$ in equation implies $f(0)=0$ and so $f(x)=xa(x)$
Let $z$ a complex root of $x^2+x+1=0$. Pluging $z$ in equation implies $g(0)=0$ and so $g(x)=xb(x)$

And equation becomes $a(x^2-x+1)=b(x^2+x+1)$ $\forall x$ (even for roots of $x^2\pm x+1=0$ because continuity).

Let $u(x)=a(x+\frac 34)$ and $v(x)=b(x+\frac 34)$ and the equations becomes $u((x-\frac 12)^2)=v((x+\frac 12)^2)$ and so $u(x^2)=v((x+1)^2)$ $\forall x$

Let then the polynomial $h(x)=u(x^2)=v((x+1)^2)$ : $h(x)=h(-x)$ and $h(x)=h(-x-2)$ and so $h(x)=h(x+2)$ 

But the only periodic polynomial is the constant one. So $h(x)=c$ and, since polynomials, $u(x),v(x),a(x),b(x)$ are constant.

And so $\boxed{f(x)=g(x)=cx}$ $\forall x$

Suppose that such a polynomial $P(x)$ exists with no real roots.

$P(x)$ has a constant sign and so WLOG say $P(x)>0$ $\forall x$ (changing $P(x)\to -P(x)$ if necessary)
$P(x)$ has an even degree (since no real roots) and has a global minimum $m>0$
Let $x$ such that $P(a_3x+b_3)=m$ (possible since $a_3\ne 0$).

Then both $P(a_1x+b_1)$ and $P(a_2x+b_2)$ are $<m$, which is impossible. (and we just needed $a_3\ne 0$ and not $a_1a_2a_3\ne 0$)

Hence the required result.

Let's $P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}c_ix^i$, $c_n \ne 0$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Since $c_n(a_jx+b_j)^n=c_na_j^nx^n+...$ then equating the coefficients of $x^n$ in the original equation we get: $a_1^n+a_2^n=a_3^n$.
If $a_1=a_2=a_3=a$ then $2a^n=a^n$ and $a=0$ - a contradiction.
So $a_1 \ne a_3$ or $a_2 \ne a_3$. WLOG $a_2 \ne a_3$. For $x=\frac{b_3-b_2}{a_2-a_3}$ we have: $a_2x+b_2=a_3x+b_3 \implies P(a_2x+b_2)=P(a_3x+b_3) \implies P(a_1x+b_1)=0$. Thus $x=\frac{a_1b_3-a_1b_2+a_2b_1-a_3b_1}{a_2-a_3}$ is the root of $P$.

Find the remainder of $h(x) = f(x) g(x)$ when it is divided by $(x-m)(x-n)$\end{tcolorbox}
So $f(x)=u(x)(x-m)(x-n)+ax+b$ with $am+b=p_1$ and $an+b=p_2$ and so $a=\frac{p_1-p_2}{m-n}$ and $b=\frac{p_2m-p_1n}{m-n}$

And $g(x)=v(x)(x-m)(x-n)+cx+d$ with $cm+d=q_1$ and $cn+d=q_2$ and so $c=\frac{q_1-q_2}{m-n}$ and $d=\frac{q_2m-q_1n}{m-n}$

Hence the answer : $(ad+bc+ac(m+n))x+bd-acmn$ $=\boxed{\frac{(p_1q_1-p_2q_2)x+p_2q_2m-p_1q_1n}{m-n}}$

	[hide]Applying the remainder theorem on both poylnomials at both points:
$f(m) = p_1$ and $f(n) = p_2$
$g(m) = q_1$ and $g(n) = q_2$

Using the definition of $h(x)$, we get:
$h(m) = p_1q_1$
$h(n) = p_2q_2$

We want to find the linear function $R(x) = ax + b$ such that:

$h(x) = (x-m)(x-n)Q(x) + R(x)$ for some quotient $Q(x)$ (which isn't important) and for some remainder $R(x)$ (which IS important).

Plug in $x=m$ and $x=n$ again, and we get:

$h(m) = R(m)$ and $h(n) = R(n)$

$p_1q_1 = am + b$ and $p_2q_2 = an + b$

Believe it or not, that's two equations with "only" two variables to eliminate:  $a$ and $b$.  Everything else is a parameter\/"given".  Equating the $b$s, we get:

$p_1q_1 - am = p_2q_2 - an$

$an - am = p_2q_2 - p_1q_1$

$a = \frac{p_2q_2 - p_1q_1}{n-m}$

Plug that back into $p_1q_1 = am + b$, and you get:

$p_1q_1 = m\frac{p_2q_2 - p_1q_1}{n-m} + b$

$b =  \frac{p_1q_1n - p_1q_1m + mp_1q_1 - mp_2q_2}{n-m}$

The two middle terms in the numerator cancel.  

So, we  have $R(x) = \boxed{\frac{p_2q_2 - p_1q_1}{n-m} \cdot x + \frac{np_1q_1 - mp_2q_2}{n-m}}$[\/hide]

Beaten, but too much text to waste, and maybe a different way of explaining it.  Plus, mine's backwards. :)

EDIT:  I just noticed there's another, perhaps more "elegant", way to express the answer:

[hide]$\frac{p_1q_1(x-n) - p_2q_2(x-m)}{m-n}$

Note that if $x=m$, the answer reduces to ${\frac{p_1q_1(m-n)}{m-n}} = p_1q_1$, and that if $x=n$, the answer reduces to $\frac{-p_2q_2(n-m)}{m-n} = p_2q_2$.  This makes sense - since $h(m) = p_1q_1$, the remainder of $h(x)$ when divided by $m$ should be $p_1q_1$.[\/hide]

	first... we dont know that $q(-1) = 0$, rather, we know that $q(1) = q(0) = 0$

$q(-1) = p(-1) - p(-2) = -p(-2)$ but we know nothing of $p(-2)$ (plus, checking your $q(x) = C(x^2-1)$ in the original $(x+1)q(x) = (x-1)q(x+1)$ shows that it is not correct)

hence, using an adjusted form of ur reasoning, $q(x) = Cx(x-1)$

checking this in $(x+1)q(x) = (x-1)q(x+1)$ we see that this holds

then, again using your reasoning since $p(x)$ has degree at most $3$ (this is from setting $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$, expanding, and noting that the $x^{n-1}$ terms don't cross out), we know

$p(x) - p(x-1) = x(x-1) = x^2-x$

setting $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, we get:

$p(x) - p(x-1) = a(3x^2 - 3x + 1) + b(2x-1) + c = x^2 - x$

equating coefficients, we get:

$a = \frac{1}{3}$, $b = 0$, and $c = - \frac{1}{3}$ (again, all scaled by $C$)

so:

$p(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{3}x + d$ and letting $x = 0$, we know that since $p(0) = 0$, then $d= 0$ and finally that:

$p(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{3}x$ is a solution (checking we see that it holds)

also, i dont know if we have to include the fact, from $(x+1)q(x) = (x-1)q(x+1)$, when $q(x) = 0$, in which case we know $p(x) = p(x-1) = k$ for some constant $k$

checking this, we see that when $p(x)$ is a constant our original expression holds as well

thus we have our two solutions for $p(x)$?

Huh ?
Just saying "checking we see that it holds" is not enough. Better to really check 

Let us publicly check :

$P(x)=\frac 13x(x^2-1)$

$(x+1)P(x-1)=\frac 13(x+1)(x-1)(x^2-2x)$

$(x-1)P(x+1)=\frac 13(x-1)(x+1)(x^2+2x)$

$(x+1)P(x-1)+(x-1)P(x+1)=\frac 23x^2(x^2-1)$ $\ne 2P(x)=\frac 23x(x^2-1)$

Here is a complete ugly calculus proof giving the unique root (finding a root is trivial and the real problem is uniqueness).
I did not find anything more clever.
Could you kindly post your own proof of uniqueness, please ?
Thanks in advance.


Finding a root is quite simple since we at least have the roots of $f(x)=x$ :

$\sqrt{4+\sqrt{4-x}}=x$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[0,4]$ and $\sqrt{4-x}=x^2-4$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[2,4]$ and $x^4-8x^2+x+12=0$ $\iff$ $(x^2-x-3)(x^2+x-4)=0$ 
And so a first solution $\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}2$

The real problem is to see if there exists some roots of $f(f(x))$ which are not roots of $f(x)=x$
$\sqrt{4+\sqrt{4-\sqrt{4+\sqrt{4-x}}}}=x$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[0,4]$ and $\sqrt{4-\sqrt{4+\sqrt{4-x}}}=x^2-4$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[2,4]$ and $\sqrt{4+\sqrt{4-x}}=(x^2-2)(6-x^2)$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[2,\sqrt 6]$ and ${\sqrt{4-x}}=(x^4-8x^2+14)(x^4-8x^2+10)$
$\iff$ (squaring) $x\in[2,\sqrt {4+\sqrt 2}]$ and $(x^4-8x^2+14)^2(x^4-8x^2+10)^2+x-4=0$
This a degree $16$ polynomial and we know that $(x^2-x-3)(x^2+x-4)$ must divide it. and so we get a degree $12$ polynomial equation :

$h(x)=x^{12}-24x^{10}$ $-x^9+228x^8$ $+16x^7-1087x^6$ $-88x^5+2720x^4$ $+191x^3-3380x^2$ $-136x+1633=0$
$h(-3)>0$
$h(-\frac 52)<0$ and so at least a root $x_1\in(-3,-\frac 52)$
$h(-\frac 73)>0$ and so at least a root $x_2\in(-\frac 52,-\frac 73)$
$h(-2)<0$ and so at least a root $x_3\in(-\frac 73,-2)$
$h(-\frac 53)>0$ and so at least a root $x_4\in(-2,-\frac 53)$
$h(-\frac 32)<0$ and so at least a root $x_5\in(-\frac 53,-\frac 32)$
$h(0)>0$ and so at least a root $x_6\in(-\frac 32,0)$
$h(\frac 54)<0$ and so at least a root $x_7\in(0,\frac 54)$
$h(\frac 32)>0$ and so at least a root $x_8\in(\frac 54,\frac 32)$
$h(2)<0$ and so at least a root $x_9\in(\frac 32,2)$
$h(\frac 52)>0$ and so at least a root $x_{10}\in(2,\frac 52)$
$h(\frac {28}{11})<0$ and so at least a root $x_{11}\in(\frac 52,\frac {28}{11})$
$h(3)>0$ and so at least a root $x_{12}\in(\frac {28}{11},3)$

And so fortunately $h(x)$ has all its $12$ roots real.
$x_9<2<x_{10}$ and $x_9<\sqrt{4+\sqrt 2}<\frac 52<x_{11}$ and so it remains to locate $\sqrt{4+\sqrt 2}$ in front of $x_{10}$

$h(\frac 73)<0$ and so $x_9<\frac 73<x_{10}$ and so $x_9<2<\sqrt{4+\sqrt 2}<\frac 73<x_{10}$
And so no real root of $h(x)$ in $[2,\sqrt {4+\sqrt 2}]$

Hence the unique root of the original problem $\boxed{x=\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}2}$

Considering each nested radical in turn, from the innermost outwards, we see also that $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing over this range.
We have also: $f(f(0)) = 2.29$ and $f(f(4)) = 2.33$, correct to two decimal places.
We conclude that the graph of $y = f(f(x))$, for 0 less than or equal to $x$ less than or equal to $4$, is almost a straight line, with average slope approximately $0.01$.

Since $f(f(x))$ is a continuous function, it follows that $y = f(f(x))$ intersects the line $y = x$, for $0$ less than or equal to $x$ less than or equal to $4$.
Furthermore, $y = f(f(x)$ will intersect $y = x$ precisely once, provided that no section of $y = f(f(x))$ has a slope greater than $1$.
This is clearly the case, and may be verified, if necessary, by differentiating $f(f(x))$ with respect to $x$. [\/hide]

	Is this an equation in $a$ or $x$? And if so, what is the role of the other variable in the equation?

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all values of $m$ such that the eqaution

$m(x-a)^{3} -(x+a)^{2} =0$

has three distinct roots.\end{tcolorbox}

There is a theorem that says if a polynomial equation has a double root then the derivative of this polynomial has the same root (if you don't know, prove it!). hence:

$ 3m{(x-a)}^2 - 2{(x+a)} = 0 $
$ 3m{(x-a)}^2 = 2{(x+a)} $

Dividing the first equation given by the equation above:

$ x=-5a $

This is the unique common root between this two equations. Then:

$m(-5a-a)^{3} -(-5a+a)^{2} =0$

$ m=-\frac{2}{27a} $

If there is three equal roots we can do derivative again:

$ 6m{(x-a)} - 2 = 0 $

deviding the first derivative by the second we find the value of x which can be the triple root:

$ x=-3a $

Replacing:

$m(-3a-a)^{3} -(-3a+a)^{2} =0$

$m=-\frac{1}{16a} $

then the values for m wich gives two or three equal roots to the equation is:

$ -\frac{1}{16a} , -\frac{2}{27a} $
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/25405}{AndrewTom}]
	Thanks. The equation is in $x$ and $a$ is a (positive) constant.

My solution is as follows:

Consider the curve $m= \frac{(x+a)^{2}}{(x-a)^{2}}$

We get three distinct roots iff the horizontal line $y=m$ crosses the curve in three distinct points.

Vertical asymptote: $x=a$; when $x=0$,  $y= \frac{-1}{a}$; when $y=0$  $x=-a$.

The derivative is zero for $x=-a$ and $x=-5a$,

The x-axis is tangential to the curve at $(-a, 0)$ and $(-5a, \frac{-2}{27a})$ is a local minimum.

So we get three distinct rots for $\frac{-2}{27a} < m < 0$.

I wonder if there are alternative (and better) solutions which is why I posted it here and not in the calculus forum.
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/29428}{pco}]
	Here is my (calculus) method, more complex, in my opinion, than yours :

$m\ne 0$ else the equation has a unique root $-a$

Then the equation is a cubic and a cubic $f(x)$ has three distinct root iff $f'(x)$ has two distinct roots $r_1,r_2$ and $f(r_1)f(r_2)<0$

$f(x)=m(x-a)^3-(x+a)^2$ and so $f'(x)=3m(x-a)^2-2(x+a)$ $=3mx^2-2x(3am+1)+3ma^2-2a$

Discriminant is $4((3am+1)^2-3m(3ma^2-2a))=4(12am+1)$ and so we first need $12am+1>0$

Let us write $12am+1=u^2$ with $u>0$ and the two roots of $f'(x)$ are $r_1=\frac{3am+1- u}{3m}$ and $r_2=\frac{3am+1+ u}{3m}$

$f(r_1)=m\left(\frac{1- u}{3m}\right)^3-\left(\frac{6am+1- u}{3m}\right)^2$

Writing $6am=\frac{u^2-1}2$ and simplifying, we get $108m^2f(r_1)=(u-1)^3(1+3u)$

$f(r_2)=m\left(\frac{1+ u}{3m}\right)^3-\left(\frac{6am+1+ u}{3m}\right)^2$

Writing $6am=\frac{u^2-1}2$ and simplifying, we get $108m^2f(r_2)=(u+1)^3(3u-1)$

And so the constraint is $(u^2-1)^3(9u^2-1)<0$ and so $u^2=12am+1\in(\frac 19,1)$

Hence the answer $\boxed{am\in\left(-\frac 2{27},0\right)}$
\end{solution}

If $P(x)=c$ constant, we get $c=c^2$ and so the two solutions $P(x)=0$ $\forall x$ and $P(x)=1$ $\forall x$

If $P(x)$ is not constant, let $a_nx^n$ with $n>0$ and $a_n\ne 0$ the greatest degree summand of $P(x)$
Comparing the greatest degrees summands in $P(x^2)$ and $P(x)^2$, we get $a_n=1$

If $P(x)$ is not constant and has a unique summand, we get  $P(x)=x^n$ which indeed are solutions.

If $P(x)$ is not constant and has at least two summands, let $x^n+a_px^p$ with $n>p\ge 0$ and $a_p\ne 0$ the two greatest degrees summands.
Then the two greatest degrees summands of $P(x^2)$ are $x^{2n}+a_px^{2p}$ while the two greatest degrees summands of $P(x)^2$ are $x^{2n}+2a_px^{n+p}$, impossible.

For easier writing, let $c_k=\cos\frac{k\pi}7$

It's easy to get that $c_1-c_2+c_3=\frac 12$ and so that a solution is $(p,q,r)=(2,-2,2)$

So any other solution is $(2+a,-2+b,2+c)$ such that $ac_1+bc_2+cc_3=0$
But $c_3=4c_1^3-3c_1$ and $c_2=2c_1^2-1$
And so $c_1$ is root of $4cx^3+2bx^2+(a-3c)x-b=0$

But it's not very difficult to establish that minimal monic polynomial of $\mathbb Q[X]$ whose $c1$ is solution is $x^3-\frac 12x^2-\frac 12x+\frac 18$

And so, looking at coefficients of degrees $2$ and $0$, we get that $a=b=c=0$

And so the unique solution $\boxed{(p,q,r)=(2,-2,2)}$

$f(x)=\frac{(1+ix)^n+(1-ix)^n}2$ and $g(x)=i\frac{(1-ix)^n-(1+ix)^n}2$

And so $f(x)+kg(x)=(1+ix)^n\frac{1-ki}2+(1-ix)^n\frac{1+ki}2$

1) case where $k\ne 0$ 
================
Equation is $(1+ix)^n(1-ki)+(1-ix)^n(1+ki)=0$ and so, since $x=-i$ is not a solution :

$\left(\frac{1+ix}{1-ix}\right)^n=\frac{1+ki}{-1+ki}$ $=e^{it}$ for some real $t$ which is not an integer multiple of $\pi$

And so $\frac{1+ix}{1-ix}=e^{ia_k}$ where $\{a_k=\frac{t+2k\pi}n\}_{k=0}^{n-1}$ is an arithmetic sequence of real numbers with common difference $\frac{2\pi}n$ 

And so $x=\tan\frac{a_k}2$ (which is defined since no $a_k$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$)

And so $f(x)+kg(x)$ is a real polynomial with degree $n$ and we got $n$ distinct real roots.
Hence the result.

2) case where $k=0$
==============
Equation is $(1+ix)^n+(1-ix)^n=0$ and so, since $x=-i$ is not a solution :

$\left(\frac{1+ix}{1-ix}\right)^n=e^{i\pi}$

And so $\frac{1+ix}{1-ix}=e^{i\frac{(2k+1)\pi}n}$ wher $k=0,..,n-1$

And so, if $n$ is odd, $n-1$ real solutions $\tan \frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2n}$ where $k=0,...,n-1$ except $k=\frac{n-1}2$

And, if $n$ is even, $n$ real solutions $\tan \frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2n}$ where $k=0,...,n-1$

And since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ if $n$ is even, and of degree $n-1$ if $n$ is odd, we got the result.

	Let $P(x) = ax^2+bx+c$. Then $\Delta(x) = P(x^3+x) - P(x^2+1) =$ $ P(x(x^2+1)) - P(x^2+1) =$ $ (x-1)(x^2+1)(a(x+1)(x^2+1) + b)$. Since we need $\Delta(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$, we need $x-1 \mid a(x+1)(x^2+1) + b$, i.e. $4a + b = 0$. Therefore $b= -4a$, and so by Viète's relation, the sum of the roots of $P(x)$ is $\boxed{x_1 + x_2 = -\dfrac {b} {a} = 4}$.
Indeed $\Delta(x) = a(x-1)^2(x^2+1)(x^2+2x +3) \geq 0$ for all $x$ (since the discriminant of $x^2+2x +3$ is negative), provided we take $a>0$. Therefore all such polynomials are of the form $P(x) = k^2(x^2 - 4x + C)$.

Another method (a bit too late) :)

Writing $f(x)=P(x^3+x)-P(x^2+1)$, we get $f(x)\ge 0$, $C_{\infty}$ and $f(1)=0$ and so $f'(1)=0$ and so $P'(2)=0$

Writing $P(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\ne 0$, then $P'(2)=0$ becomes $4a+b=0$ and so $-\frac ba=4$

And so, if such a quadratic exists the sum of roots is $\boxed{4}$

	but with it  you can say that \[x^12-x^9+x^4-x+1\geq 0\]
it can be 0 you can't say that it is >0 .

I dont understand what you mean. With my equality, I got $x^{12}-x^9+x^4-x+1\ge \frac{433}{960}>0$

Just great.
But how can one ever think of something like this.

	I was able to explain to myself how he chose the setup for $\left(x^6-\frac{x^3}2-\frac18\right)^2$ because it takes care of the terms $x^{12}-x^9$ and vanishing the $x^6$ terms. The same can be deduced for the term $-\frac{x}{16}$ to eliminate the terms $x^4-\frac18x^3$, but how he got $-\frac12$ in that second square still beats me.... after that the rest is just cake-simple complete the square to finish up.

	As 10000th User said, choosing $x^6-\frac {x^3}2-\frac 18$ is rather normal. And also the $x^2-\frac x{16}$ and indeed I found them in that way.

For the $-\frac 12$, what I did is :

$x^{12}-x^9+x^4-x+1$ $-\left(x^6-\frac{x^3}2-\frac 18\right)^2$ $-\left(x^2-\frac x{16}+a\right)^2$ $=-(2a+\frac 1{256})x^2+(\frac a8-1)x+\frac{63}{64}-a^2$

And so we just have to choose $a$ such that this quadratic has a positive leading coefficient and a negative discriminant. So :

$a<-\frac 1{512}$ and $(\frac a8-1)^2+4(2a+\frac 1{256})(\frac {63}{64}-a^2)<0$

$\iff$ $a<-\frac 1{512}$ and $-8a^3+\frac{61a}8+\frac{4159}{4096}<0$

And studying this cubic shows that some suitable values exist in $(-1,0)$ so that $a=-\frac 12$ is a "natural" try.

 ============================================

Btw, notice that this equality is my answer to the OP question "But I want to solve Using Completing Square Method Like $x^{12}-x^9+x^4-x+1 = A^2+B^2+C^2>0\forall x\in \mathbb{R}$"

The simpliest solution to the original problem is the one suggested by minhphuc.v in his\/her post :

If $x\ge 1$, then $x^{12}\ge x^9$ and $x^4\ge x$ and so $x^{12}-x^9+x^4-x+1$ $=(x^{12}-x^9)+(x^4-x)+1\ge 1>0$
If $x< 1$, then $x^{12}\ge 0$ and $x^9\le x^4$ and so $x^{12}-x^9+x^4-x+1$ $=x^{12}+(x^4-x^9)+(1-x)> 0$
\end{solution}
