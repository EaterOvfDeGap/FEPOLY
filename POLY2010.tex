@all \end{underlined}: MJ GEO asks a lot for solutions and never accepts to post his own solutions ... So here is mine for the first of these two problems.

@voong \end{underlined}: You have quite interesting toys in your country   . I tried your hint but found ugly heavy systems of equation and did not succeed. Could you, please, give us your full solution, up to the end (not just "is a quite toy with equating coefficients") ?. Thanks in advance.

My solution :
Since $ 1+\sqrt 3$ and $ 1-\sqrt 3$ are solutions of $ x^2-2=2x$, $ P(x)=1+\sqrt 3$ and $ P(x)=1-\sqrt 3$ are solutions.
Suppose now there exists a solution with degree $ \ge 1$
Let $ P(x)$ such a solution with the fewest positive degree.

Obviously $ P(x)^2=P(-x)^2$ and so (since polynomials), either $ P(x)$ is odd, either $ P(x)$ is even

1) if $ P(x)$ is odd :
$ P(x)=xQ(x^2)$ and the equation becomes : $ x^2Q(x^2)^2-2=2(2x^2-1)Q((2x^2-1)^2)$
Setting $ x=0$ in this equality, we get $ Q(1)=1$
Setting $ x=1$ in this equality, we get $ Q(1)^2-2=2Q(1)$
Hence contradiction and $ P(x)$ is not odd.

2) If $ P(x)$ is even :
$ P(x)=Q(x^2)$ and the equation becomes : $ Q(x^2)^2-2=2Q((2x^2-1)^2)$
So $ Q(x)^2-2=2Q((2x-1)^2)$ (remember these are polynomials).

Let then $ R(x)=Q(\frac{x+1}2)$ and so $ Q(x)=R(2x-1)$. The equation becomes $ R(2x-1)^2-2=2R(2(2x-1)^2-1)$ and so $ R(x)^2-2=2R(2x^2-1)$

And so $ R(x)$ is a solution too, but degree($ R$)=degree($ Q$)=$ \frac 12$degree($ P$), hence a contradiction since $ P(x)$ was supposed to be with the fewest positive degree.

Hence the two unique solutions :

$ \boxed{P(x)=1+\sqrt 3}$ and $ \boxed{P(x)=1-\sqrt 3}$
\end{solution}

For this one, I found a solution nearly similar (see previous post), except for elimination of the case "odd", more complex :

My solution :
Since $ 2+\sqrt 5$ and $ 2-\sqrt 5$ are solutions of $ x^2-1=4x$, $ P(x)=2-\sqrt 5$ and $ P(x)=2+\sqrt 5$ are solutions.
Suppose now there exists a solution with degree $ \ge 1$
Let $ P(x)$ such a solution with the fewest positive degree.

We can write the equation $ P(x)^2-1=4P((x-2)^2-3)$, and so $ P(x+2)^2-1=4P(x^2-3)$ and so $ P_1(x)^2-1=4P_1(x^2-5)$ where $ P_1(x)=P(x+2)$

Obviously $ P_1(x)^2=P_1(-x)^2$ and so (since polynomials), either $ P_1(x)$ is odd, either $ P_1(x)$ is even

1) if $ P_1(x)$ is odd :
Let $ x\in[-5,+5]$ : $ P_1(\sqrt{x+5})^2-1=4P_1(x)$ and so $ P_1(x)\ge -1$
Since $ P_1$ is odd, we also get $ P_1(x)\le 1$

So $ \forall x\in[-5,+5]$, $ -1\le P_1(x)\le +1$ and so $ P_1(x)^2\le 1$ and so $ P_1(x)^2-1=P_1(x^2-5)\le 0$

And so $ P_1(x)\le 0$ $ \forall x\in[-5,20]$ but this implies, since $ P_1(x)$ is odd : $ P_1(x)=0$, impossible
Hence $ P(x)$ is not odd.

2) If $ P_1(x)$ is even :
$ P_1(x)=Q(x^2)$ and the equation becomes : $ Q(x^2)^2-1=4Q((x^2-5)^2)$
So $ Q(x)^2-1=2Q((x-5)^2)$ (remember these are polynomials).

Let then $ R(x)=Q(x+5)$ and so $ Q(x)=R(x-5)$. The equation becomes $ R(x-5)^2-1=4R((x-5)^2-5)$ and so $ R(x)^2-1=4R(x^2-5)$

And so $ R(x)$ is a solution too, but degree($ R$)=degree($ Q$)=$ \frac 12$degree($ P$), hence a contradiction since $ P(x)$ was supposed to be with the fewest positive degree.

Hence the two unique solutions :

$ \boxed{P(x)=2-\sqrt 5}$ and $ \boxed{P(x)=2+\sqrt 5}$

My solution :
Since $ 2 + \sqrt 5$ and $ 2 - \sqrt 5$ are solutions of $ x^2 - 1 = 4x$, $ P(x) = 2 - \sqrt 5$ and $ P(x) = 2 + \sqrt 5$ are solutions.
Suppose now there exists a solution with degree $ \ge 1$

We can write the equation $ P(x)^2 - 1 = 4P((x - 2)^2 - 3)$, and so $ P(x + 2)^2 - 1 = 4P(x^2 - 3)$ and so $ P_1(x)^2 - 1 = 4P_1(x^2 - 5)$ where $ P_1(x) = P(x + 2)$

Obviously $ P_1(x)^2 = P_1( - x)^2$ and so (since polynomials), either $ P_1(x)$ is odd, either $ P_1(x)$ is even

1) if $ P_1(x)$ is odd :
Let $ x\in[ - 5, + 5]$ : $ P_1(\sqrt {x + 5})^2 - 1 = 4P_1(x)$ and so $ P_1(x)\ge - 1$
Since $ P_1$ is odd, we also get $ P_1(x)\le 1$

So $ \forall x\in[ - 5, + 5]$, $ - 1\le P_1(x)\le + 1$ and so $ P_1(x)^2\le 1$ and so $ P_1(x)^2 - 1 = P_1(x^2 - 5)\le 0$

And so $ P_1(x)\le 0$ $ \forall x\in[ - 5,20]$ but this implies, since $ P_1(x)$ is odd : $ P_1(x) = 0$, impossible
Hence $ P(x)$ is not odd.

$ P_1(x) = Q(x^2)$ and the equation becomes : $ Q(x^2)^2 - 1 = 4Q((x^2 - 5)^2)$

Let then $ R(x) = Q(x + 5)$ and so $ Q(x) = R(x - 5)$. The equation becomes $ R(x - 5)^2 - 1 = 4R((x - 5)^2 - 5)$ and so $ R(x)^2 - 1 = 4R(x^2 - 5)$

And so $ R(x)$ is a solution too, but degree($ R$)=degree($ Q$)=$ \frac 12$degree($ P$), hence a contradiction since $ P(x)$ was supposed to be with the fewest positive degree.

I think that $ (Q(x))^2-1=4Q((x-5)^2)$ is true for all $ x\geq 0.$ So if what about $ x<0$? So, we can conclude $ R(x)$ is a solution. :) Can u explain plz. Thanks so much !

You are right. We got $ (Q(x))^2 - 1 = 4Q((x - 5)^2)$ is true for all $ x\geq 0.$

But, as I said, these are polynomials So, if polynomial $ U(x) = (Q(x))^2 - 1 - 4Q((x - 5)^2)$ is equal to $ 0$ for all $ x\ge 0$, then $ U(x) = 0$ $ \forall x$ and so $ (Q(x))^2 - 1 = 4Q((x - 5)^2)$ is true for all $ x$

\begin{tcolorbox} So, we can conclude $ R(x)$ is a solution. :) Can u explain plz. Thanks so much !\end{tcolorbox}

Setting $ P_1(x) = P(x + 2)$, we started with $ P_1(x)^2 - 1 = 4P_1(x^2 - 5)$

and we got $ R(x)^2 - 1 = 4R(x^2 - 5)$ and so, you are right : $ R(x)$ is not a solution. But $ R(x - 2)$ is :) and so the conclusion is OK.

Thanks for reading so carefully my solutions.

So $ x+y+z|f(x)+f(y)+f(z)$ and $ x+y+z|f(x)+f(y+t)+f(z-t)$ and so $ x+y+z|f(y+t)-f(y)+f(z-t)-f(z)$ $ \forall x+y+z\ne 0$

So $ f(y+t)-f(y)+f(z-t)-f(z)=0$ $ \forall y,z,t$

Choosing $ t=z$ in this last line, we get $ f(y+z)=f(y)+f(z)-f(0)$ which is a classical Cauchy's equation for $ f(x)-f(0)$ whose solution (since $ f(x)$ is continuous) is $ f(x)=ax+b$

I'm sorry for my so complex solution. In my mind, Cauchy equation is solved in 5 lines and, in my humble opinion, is not an overkiller solution.
[hide="5 lines Cauchy solution"]
============ beginning of hidden part ===============
Let $ P(x,y)$ be the assertion $ f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$

$ P(0,0)$ $ \implies$ $ f(0)=0$ and then an easy induction gives $ f(nx)=nf(x)$

So $ f(\frac pqx)=\frac pqf(x)$ and so $ f(x)=xf(1)$ $ \forall x\in\mathbb Q$

Then continuity gives $ f(x)=xf(1)$ $ \forall x$

\begin{italicized}(nota : in the following, $ \mathbb R^+$ is the set of positive reals and $ \mathbb R_0^+=\mathbb R^+\cup\{0\}$\end{italicized}

It's easy to check that $ z=\rho e^{i\theta}$ is a root of $ P(x)=0$ where $ P(x)=x^{2^n}-2\rho^{2^{n-1}}\cos(2^{n-1}\theta)x^{2^{n-1}}+\rho^{2^n}$ 

Then, for $ \theta\in(-\pi,0)\cup(0,\pi)$, consider $ n=1+ \left[\log_2(\frac{\pi}{|\theta|})\right]$ such that $ \log_2(\frac{\pi}{|\theta|})\ge n-1 > \log_2(\frac{\pi}{|\theta|})-1$ and so $ \pi\ge 2^{n-1}|\theta| >\frac{\pi}2$. 

We clearly have $ \cos(2^{n-1}\theta)<0$ and so $ P(x)\in\mathbb R_0^+[X]$

And for $ \theta=0$ or $ \rho=0$ , it obviously does not exist $ P\in\mathbb R^+[X]$ such that $ P(z)=0$

Then, multiplying $ x^{2^n}-2\rho^{2^{n-1}}\cos(2^{n-1}\theta)x^{2^{n-1}}+\rho^{2^n}$ (polynomial $ \in\mathbb R_0^+[X]$) by $ (1+x+x^2+...+x^{2^{n-1}})$, we clearly get the required polynomial $ \in\mathbb R^+[X]$

Hence rhe result : $ P(z)=0$ for some polynomial $ P\in\mathbb R^+[X]$ $ \iff$ $ z\in\mathbb C\backslash\mathbb R_0^+$

	\begin{bolded}Solution.\end{bolded}

We show that every complex number that does not lie on the nonnegative real line is a root of such polynomial. (If we allow coefficients of terms of degree less than the degree of the polynomial to be $ 0$, then only positive real number are excluded.)

First, observe that if $ w$ is a nonegative real number and $ P(z)$ is a polynomial with positive coefficients, then clearly $ P(w)>0$. Thus no $ w\geq0$ is the root of a polynomial with positive coefficients.

Every $ w=a+bi \in \mathbb{C}$ is a root of the real polynomial \[ q(z)=(z-w)(z-\overline{w})=z^2-2az+a^2+b^2.\] If $ a<0$, then $ q(z)$ is a polynomial with positive coefficients. This shows that every complex number in the open left half-plane is the root of some such polynomial.

Now assume that $ a\geq0$ and $ b\neq0$. Thus $ w$ lies in the right half-plane, but not on the real axis, so $ 0<\left | \arg(w) \right |\leq \pi\/2$. If $ n$ is the smallest positive integer for which $ \pi\/2<\left | \arg(w^n) \right |$, then $ w^n$ lies in the open left half-plane. By our work above, there exists a quadratic polynomial $ q$ with positive coefficients such that $ q(w^n)=0$there exists, say $ q(z)=z^2+c_1z+c_0$ . We now let \[ P(z)=(z^{2n}+c_1z^n+c_0)(z^{n-1}+z^{n-2}+\cdots+z+1).\] It follows that $ P(z)$ has positive coefficients and $ P(w)=0$.

Question  (college level, IMHO)  : Divide the polynomial $ P_0(x)=x^6-15x^3-8x^2+2$ by the polynomial $ Q(x)=x^2+kx+1$

Step 1\end{underlined}: divide the two highest terms and you obtained $ x^4$
So $ x^6-15x^3-8x^2+2=$ $ x^4(x^2+kx+1)-kx^5-x^4-15x^3-8x^2+2$
And so we now have to divide the polynomial $ P_1(x)=-kx^5-x^4-15x^3-8x^2+2$ by the polynomial $ Q(x)=x^2+kx+1$


Step 2\end{underlined}: divide the two highest terms and you obtained $ -kx^3$
So $ -kx^5-x^4-15x^3-8x^2+2=$ $ -kx^3(x^2+kx+1)+(k^2-1)x^4+$ $ (k-15)x^3-8x^2+2$
And so we now have to divide the polynomial $ P_2(x)=(k^2-1)x^4+(k-15)x^3-8x^2+2$ by the polynomial $ Q(x)=x^2+kx+1$

Step 3\end{underlined}: divide the two highest terms and you obtained $ (k^2-1)x^2$
So $ (k^2-1)x^4+(k-15)x^3-8x^2+2$ $ =(k^2-1)x^2(x^2+kx+1)+$ $ (-k^3+2k-15)x^3-(k^2+7)x^2+2$
And so we now have to divide the polynomial $ P_3(x)=(-k^3+2k-15)x^3-(k^2+7)x^2+2$ by the polynomial $ Q(x)=x^2+kx+1$

Step 4\end{underlined}: divide the two highest terms and you obtained $ (-k^3+2k-15)x$
So $ (-k^3+2k-15)x^3-(k^2+7)x^2+2$ $ =(-k^3+2k-15)x(x^2+kx+1)+$ $ (k^4-3k^2+15k-7)x^2+(k^3-2k+15)x+2$
And so we now have to divide the polynomial $ P_4(x)=$ $ (k^4-3k^2+15k-7)x^2+$ $ (k^3-2k+15)x+2$ by the polynomial $ Q(x)=x^2+kx+1$

Step 5\end{underlined}: divide the two highest terms and you obtained $ k^4-3k^2+15k-7$
So $ (k^4-3k^2+15k-7)x^2+(k^3-2k+15)x+2$ $ =(k^4-3k^2+15k-7)(x^2+kx+1)+$ $ (-k^5+4k^3-15k^2+5k+15)x-k^4+3k^2-15k+9$
And we are done.

So $ P(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2$

\[ \frac {P(x)}{Q(x)} - \frac {P(x + 1)}{Q(x + 1)} = \frac {1}{x(x + 2)}\]
\end{tcolorbox}

If we have an irreductible solution $ \frac UV$, then all other solutions may differ only with a constant (since $ \frac PQ-\frac UV$ is periodic, so is constant).

And so $ \frac PQ=\frac UV+c=\frac{U+cV}V$ and so the general solution is $ (P,Q)=((U+cV)R, VR)$

In order to find one solution, it's natural to look for something as $ \frac U{x(x+1)}$. Testing then $ U=ax+b$, we immediately find the solution $ \frac{2x+1}{2x(x+1)}$

Hence the general solution $ (P,Q)=((2x+1+2cx(x+1))R,2x(x+1)R)$, which may be written $ \boxed{(P,Q)=((ax^2+(a+2)x+1)R,2x(x+1)R)}$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all polynomials $ P(x)$ satisfying ther equation

$ (x + 1)P(x) = (x - 2010)P(x + 1)$.\end{tcolorbox}
$ (x-a)P(x)=(x-b)P(x+1)$ with $ b>a+1$ implies $ P(a+1)=0$ (setting $ x=a$) and $ P(b)=0$ (setting $ x=b$)
So $ P(x)=(x-b)(x-(a+1))Q(x)$ and we get $ (x-a)(x-b)(x-(a+1))Q(x)=(x-b)(x+1-b)(x-a)Q(x+1)$  and so $ (x-(a+1))Q(x)=(x-(b-1))Q(x+1)$

So a simple induction, from $ (x+1)P(x)=(x-2010)P(x+1)$, gives :
$ P(x)=[x(x-2010)][(x-1)(x-2009)]...[(x-1004)(x-1006)]Q(x)$ and $ (x-1004)Q(x)=(x-1005)Q(x+1)$

From this last equality, we get $ Q(1005)=0$ and so $ Q(x)=(x-1005)R(x)$ and $ R(x)=R(x+1)$ and so $ R(x)=c$

Hence the solution : $ \boxed{P(x)=c\prod_{k=0}^{2010}(x-k)}$

I suppose we must read " such that for each $ n\in\mathbb{N}$"

Yes, such a sequence exists and it is possible to build it with induction.

Let $ a_0=-1$ and $ a_1=1$ such that the property is true for $ n=1$
Let $ P_n=\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k$ with $ n$ distinct roots $ r_1<r_2<...<r_n$
Let $ x_0<r_1$
Let $ x_k\in(r_k,r_{k+1})$ $ \forall k\in[1,n-1]$ the value in $ (r_k,r_{k+1})$ where $ |P_n(x)|$ is maximum.
Let $ x_n>r_n$

$ P_n(x_k)\ne 0$ $ \forall k\in[0,n]$ and so we can choose $ a>0$ such that $ a|x_k|^{n+1}<|P_n(x_k)|$ $ \forall k\in[0,n]$

If $ P_n(x_n)>0$, let $ a_{n+1}=-a$
If $ P_n(x_n)<0$, let $ a_{n+1}=a$

$ a|x_k|^{n+1}<|P_n(x_k)|$ implies that $ P_{n+1}(x_k)=P_n(x_k)+a_{n+1}x^{n+1}$ is always non zero and has the same sign as $ P_n(x_k)$
and $ \lim_{x\to+\infty}P_{n+1}(x)$ has a sign different from $ P_{n+1}(x_n)$. So :

$ P_{n+1}(x)$ has a root in $ (x_k,x_{k+1})$ $ \forall k\in[0,n-1]$ and a root above $ x_n$

I'm sorry, I cant give you any theoretical background on this topic. I even did not know this had a name. I dont know if it is used with differential equation or not.

I just say that :
a) degree of $ P_{k + 1}$ is obviously degree of $ P_{k}$ minus one id degree of $ P_{k+1}(x) > 0$
b) knowledge of $ P_{k + 1}(x)$ implies knowledge of $ P_k(x)$ except the constant term. And constant term may obviously be fully determined by checking any value.

So knowledge of  $ P_3(x)$ of degree $ 0$ implies full knowledge of $ P(x)$ of degree $ 3$.

Example :
$ P_3(x) = 6$
$ \implies$ $ P_2(x) = 6x + c$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P_2( - 2) = - 10$ gives $ c = 2$ and $ P_2(x) = 6x + 2$
$ \implies$ $ P_1(x) = 3x^2 - x + d$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P_1( - 2) = 16$ gives $ d = 2$ and $ P_1(x) = 3x^2 - x + 2$
$ \implies$ $ P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + e$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P(0) = 7$ gives $ e = 7$ and $ P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 7$

So I proved there existed a degree $ 3$ solution.

	\begin{tcolorbox}[quote="math12061992"]  @pco,If my understanding is not wrong then finite difference method is applied in case of differential equation.You have found out $ P_1(x),P_2(x),P_3(x)$ where $ P_3(x)$ yielding a constant value of 6.Then how do you come to the conclusion?? :blush:  :blush: .Could you please give me the theoretical background?? :oops: .I think that's the place I'm stucked.Your strategy(I THINK THIS IS THE STANDARD ONE) is unknown to me!! :(\end{tcolorbox}

I'm sorry, I cant give you any theoretical background on this topic. I even did not know this had a name. I dont know if it is used with differential equation or not.

I just say that :
a) degree of $ P_{k + 1}$ is obviously degree of $ P_{k}$ minus one id degree of $ P_{k + 1}(x) > 0$
b) knowledge of $ P_{k + 1}(x)$ implies knowledge of $ P_k(x)$ except the constant term. And constant term may obviously be fully determined by checking any value.

So knowledge of  $ P_3(x)$ of degree $ 0$ implies full knowledge of $ P(x)$ of degree $ 3$.

Example :
$ P_3(x) = 6$
$ \implies$ $ P_2(x) = 6x + c$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P_2( - 2) = - 10$ gives $ c = 2$ and $ P_2(x) = 6x + 2$
$ \implies$ $ P_1(x) = 3x^2 - x + d$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P_1( - 2) = 16$ gives $ d = 2$ and $ P_1(x) = 3x^2 - x + 2$
$ \implies$ $ P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + e$ (just coeff identification) and then $ P(0) = 7$ gives $ e = 7$ and $ P(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 7$

So I proved there existed a degree $ 3$ solution.
And, reverse way : if it existed a solution with degree less than $ 3$, then $ P_1(x)$ would be of degree less than $ 2$ and $ P_2(x)$ would be of degree less than $ 1$, so constant. And since $ P_2( - 2)\ne P_2( - 1)$, no solution with degree less than $ 3$ existed.

[hide="Some more details"]
Suppose $\exists a_k\in\mathbb N$ such that $Q(a_k)\equiv 0\pmod{p^k}$ and let then $b_k=\frac{Q(a_k)}{p^k}$

Looking at $Q(a_k+p^kb_k)\pmod{p^{k+1}}$, we get :

$Q(a_k+p^kb_k)\equiv$ $(p-1)(a_k+p^kb_k)^p-a_k-p^kb_k-1\equiv$ $(p-1)a^k-a_k-1-p^kb_k\equiv$ $Q(a_k)-p^kb_k\equiv 0\pmod{p^{k+1}}$

And since $\frac{p-1}2\in\mathbb N$ (remember $p$ is odd) and $Q(\frac{p-1}2)\equiv 0\pmod p$, we can build easily a sequence of positive integers $a_k$, starting with $a_1=\frac{p-1}2$ and such that $Q(a_k)\equiv 0\pmod{p^k}$

And then $\{a_p+np^p,\forall n\in\mathbb N\}$ is an infinite set of positive integers $a$ such that $Q(a)\equiv 0\pmod {p^p}$

Since $f(2x)=h(f(x))$ (I suppose), we get $\text{degree}(f)=\text{degree}(h)\text{degree}(f)$ and so :

Either $f(x)=c$ constant and $h(c)=c$
Either $\text{degree}(f)>0^$ and $h(x)=ax+b$ and then :

Let $f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n>0}a_kx^k$.

Identifying $x^n$ coefficients in both sides of $f(2x)=af(x)+b$, we get $a=2^n$
Identifying $x^k$ $k\in(0,n)$ coefficients in both sides of $f(2x)=af(x)+b$, we get $a_k=0$
Identifying constant coefficients in both sides of $f(2x)=af(x)+b$, we get $a_0=2^ka_0+b$

And so the solutions :

Notice that $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\ne -1$

$\alpha+1,\beta+1,\gamma+1$ are the roots of $P(x-1)=0$, so $x^3-3x^2+\frac 73=0$

So $\frac 1{\alpha +1},\frac 1{\beta+1},\frac 1{\gamma+1}$ are roots of $\frac 73x^3-3x+1=0$ and their sum is $0$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Let $f(x)=x^3-3x+1$. Find all real and distinct roots of the equation $f(f(x))=0$.\end{tcolorbox}

$f(-2)=-1<0$, $f(0)=1>0$, $f(1)=-1<0$, $f(2)=3>0$ and so $f(x)=0$ has three distinct real roots in $(-2,+2)$

Let then $x=2\cos(z)$ and the equation $f(x)=0$ becomes $8\cos(z)^3-6\cos(z)=-1$ $\iff$ $\cos(3z)=\cos(\frac{2\pi}3)$

So the roots of $f(x)=0$ are $\{2\cos(\frac{2\pi}9),$ $2\cos(\frac{8\pi}9),$ $2\cos(\frac{14\pi}9)\}$

And we have to solve three equations :
$x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)=0$
$x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{8\pi}9)=0$
$x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{14\pi}9)=0$

1) $g(x)=x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)=0$
------------------------------------------------------
$g(-2)=g(1)=-1-2\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)<0$
$g(-1)=g(2)=3-2\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)>0$
So three real roots in $(-2,2)$ and we can again write $x=2\cos(z)$ and we get $\cos(3z)=\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)-\frac 12$

And so three solutions : $\{2\cos(u),2\cos(u+\frac{2\pi}3),2\cos(u+\frac{4\pi}3)\}$ where $u=\frac 13\arccos(\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)-\frac 12)$

2) $g(x)=x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{8\pi}9)=0$
-----------------------------------------------------
$g'(-1)=g'(1)=0$ and $g(-2)=g(1)=-1-2\cos(\frac{8\pi}9)=2\cos(\frac{\pi}9)-1>0$
So a unique real root $<-2$
Setting then $x=-2\cosh(z)$, the equation becomes $\cosh(3z)=\frac 12+\cos(\frac{\pi}9)$

And so a unique solution : $\{-2\cosh(u)\}$ where $u=\frac 13\text{arccosh}(\frac 12+\cos(\frac{\pi}9))$

3) $g(x)=x^3-3x+1-2\cos(\frac{14\pi}9)=0$
----------------------------------------------------------
$g(-2)=g(1)=-1-2\cos(\frac{14\pi}9)<0$
$g(-1)=g(2)=3-2\cos(\frac{14\pi}9)>0$
So three real roots in $(-2,2)$ and we can again write $x=2\cos(z)$ and we get $\cos(3z)=\cos(\frac{4\pi}9)-\frac 12$

And so three solutions : $\{2\cos(u),2\cos(u+\frac{2\pi}3),2\cos(u+\frac{4\pi}3)\}$ where $u=\frac 13\arccos(\cos(\frac{4\pi}9)-\frac 12)$

Synthesis of solutions :
===============
The equation $f(f(x))=0$ where $f(x)=x^3-3x+1$ has exactly seven distinct real roots :

Let $u=\frac 13\arccos(\cos(\frac{2\pi}9)-\frac 12)$
Let $v=\frac 13\text{arccosh}(\frac 12+\cos(\frac{\pi}9))$
Let $w=\frac 13\arccos(\cos(\frac{4\pi}9)-\frac 12)$

The seven solutions are :
$2\cos(u)\sim 1.8147196...$
$2\cos(u+\frac{2\pi}3)\sim -1.6354357...$
$2\cos(u+\frac{4\pi}3)\sim -0.17928385...$

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find the polynomial $f(x)$ with degree $\geq 2$ such that $f(x^2)=x^3f(x-1)+4x^4+2x^2.$\end{tcolorbox}
$x^2|f(x^2)$ and so $f(x)=xg(x)$ and the equation becomes $g(x^2)=x(x-1)g(x-1)+4x^2+2$

Let $d=$degree of $g(x)$. 
If $d>2$, LHS has degree $2d$ while RHS has degree $d+2<2d$, which is impossible and so $d\le 2$ and $g(x)=ax^2+bx+c$

The equation then becomes $ax^4+bx^2+c=x(x-1)(ax^2+(b-2a)x+a-b+c)+4x^2+2$

$\iff$ $(b-3a)x^3+(3a-3b+c+4)x^2-(a-b+c)x+2-c=0$

$\iff$ $(a,b,c)=(1,3,2)$

hence the solution : $\boxed{f(x)=x^3+3x^2+2x}$
\end{solution}



\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/15024}{Farenhajt}]
	Since $\deg f(x)\geqslant 2$, the leading coefficient of the RHS is the leading coefficient of $x^3f(x-1)$. Therefore $n=\deg f(x)\implies 2n=n+3\implies n=3$.

$x=0\implies f(0)=0$

$x=1\implies f(1)=f(0)+6=6$

$x=-1\implies f(1)=-f(-2)+6\implies f(-2)=0$

Therefore $f(x)=x(x+2)(ax+b)$ for some $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$.

Plugging that into the initial equation and equating the coefficients, we find $a=b=1$.

Hence $f(x)=x(x+1)(x+2)$. Checking shows that this polynomial satisfies the given equation.

No such max exists : choose for example, for $n\in\mathbb N$, $P_n(z)=z-n$ This polynomial fits the requirements and has one unique root $z_0=n$ and so $|z_0|=n$ may be as great as we want.

	Lemma 1: This polynomial is either even or odd.

Proof: Plug $-x$ in for $x$.  Then $P(-x)^2=P(x)^2$.  Hence for all values of $x$, either $P(x)=P(-x)$ or $P(x)=-P(-x)$.  Consider the polynomials $P(x)-P(-x)$ and $P(x)+P(-x)$.  One of these has an infinite number of roots, and hence is identically 0.  Hence either $P(x)=P(-x)$ or $P(x)=-P(-x)$, and $P(x)$ is either even or odd.

Lemma 2: If the polynomial is odd, then it is $P(x)=x$.

Proof: Plug in 0 for $x$ into $P(x)=-P(-x)$.  Thus $P(0)=0$.  We can show that $P(1)=P(0^2+1)=1$ and that $P(2)=P(1^2+1)=1+1=2$, and more generally, that an infinite number of values have $P(x)=x$.  Hence it is identical to it, and $P(x)=x$.

Lemma 3: If the polynomial is even, then there is some polynomial $Q(x)$ so that $P(x)-1=Q(x)^2$.

Proof: Because the polynomial is even, it can be written as a polynomial in $x^2$.  So if we plug in $\sqrt{x-1}$ in for $x$ in $P(x)$, we get a polynomial in $x-1$, and hence in $x$.  Call this polynomial $Q(x)$, so that $P(\sqrt{x-1})=Q(x)$.  If we plug it in to the given identity, we have that $P(x)=P(\sqrt{x-1}^2+1)=P(\sqrt{x-1})^2+1=Q(x)^2+1$.

Lemma 4: The $Q(x)$ defined above also satisfies $Q(x^2+1)=Q(x)^2+1$.

Proof: We know that $Q(x)^2+1=P(x)$, and also that $Q(x)=P(\sqrt{x-1})$.  Plug in $x^2+1$ for $x$ in the last equation and hence it is true.

Using these 4 lemmas, we can show that all $P(x)$ are either a constant, namely $\frac{1\pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$, or a composition of $x^2+1$ over and over.

Knowing that $P(x)=f\circ f\circ f\ldots f$ where $f(x)=x^2+1$, we can find all the roots of $P(x)$.  They are equal to $\pm\sqrt{-1\pm\sqrt{\ldots \sqrt{-1}}}$.

I believe that if the plus and minus are chosen alternately, it approaches $-\frac{1}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2}$ which has absolute value $\sqrt{2}$.  I also believe that if $|x|=\sqrt{2}$, then any number of $x^2+1$ compositions will never reduce the absolute value to anything less than 1.  However, these statements are hard to prove, so I won't try.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Let $f(x),g(x)$ and $h(x)$ be quadratic polynomials. Is it possible that the numbers $1,2,\dots,8$ be roots of the equation $f(g(h(x)))=0$ ?\end{tcolorbox}

Nice problem, thanks :)  (although I think my own answer is not the nicest) :
No, it's not :

From $f(g(h(1)))=0$, we know that $f(x)$ has real roots. Let $a,b$ these two roots.

If $a=b$, we get $g(h(x))=a$ $\forall x\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ but this is impossible since degree of $g(h(x))$ is $4$.

So $g(h(x))=a$ has four roots in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ while $g(h(x))=b$ has the four other roots.

With the same mechanism as above, we get thet :
$g(x)-a=0$ has two distinct real roots $u,v$
$g(x)-b=0$ has two distinct real roots $w,t$
And $u+v=w+t$

So :
$h(x)-u$ has two real roots $u_1,u_2$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ 
$h(x)-v$ has two real roots $v_1,v_2$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ distinct from the one already used
$h(x)-w$ has two real roots $w_1,w_2$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ distinct from the one already used
$h(x)-t$ has two real roots $t_1,t_2$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ distinct from the one already used

And since $u_1+u_2=v_1+v_2=w_1+w_2=t_1+t_2$ and $u_1+u_2+v_1+v_2+w_1+w_2+t_1+t_2=36$, we get $u_1+u_2=v_1+v_2=w_1+w_2=t_1+t_2=9$

So the pairs are $(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)$ (in some order)

Let $h(x)=x^2-9x+q$ and we get that $q-u,q-v,q-w,q-t$ are $8,14,18,20$ in some order

And so $u,v,w,t$ are $q-8,q-14,q-18,q-20$ in some order

And so $u+v=w+t=\frac{u+v+w+t}2=2q-30$ but pairing $q-8,q-14,q-18,q-20$ can only provide sums $2q-22, 2q-26, 2q-28, 2q-32, 2q-34, 2q-38$

Hence the impossibility.

Prove that $P(x)$ is constant.\end{tcolorbox}
Here is a rather strange proof. Dont hesitate to post a simpler (and\/or) more classical one :

Notice that the functional equation implies $P(\cos(2x))=\frac{P(\cos(x))^2}2-1$.

Preliminary result : the sequence $a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n^2}2-1$ is divergent towards $+\infty$ if $|a_1|>1+\sqrt 3$, constant if $|a_1|=1+\sqrt 3$ and convergent towards $1-\sqrt 3$ is $|a_1|<1+\sqrt 3$
(not proved here, but rather classical)

Let $u\in[0,2\pi)$ : 

If $|P(\cos(u))|>1+\sqrt 3$, then $\lim_{n\to +\infty}P(\cos(2^nu))=+\infty$ which is impossible since $P([-1,+1])$ is bounded

If $|P(\cos(u))|<1+\sqrt 3$, then, since $P(\cos(x))$ is continuous, it's possible to find a real $y$ close enough of $u$ to still have $|P(\cos(y))|<1+\sqrt 3$ and such that binary representation of $\frac y{2\pi}$, from a given point, is : $0\ 1\ 00\ 01\ 10\ 11\ 000\ 001\ 010\ 011\ 100\ 101\ 110\ 111\ 0000\ 0001 ....$
Clearly $\{2^n\frac y{2\pi}\}$ is dense in $[0,1]$ and so $\cos(2^ny)$ is dense in $[-1,+1]$
And, since $\lim_{n\to +\infty}P(\cos(2^ny))=1-\sqrt 3$, we get that $P(x)=1-\sqrt 3$ is constant over $[-1,1]$

So : 
either $P(x)=1+\sqrt 3$ $\forall x$
either $P(x)=1-\sqrt 3$ $\forall x$
\end{solution}

	A slight variation on second stage of pco's proof. So we deal with $|P(\cos u)| \leq 1+\sqrt{3}$, the other case having been shown to lead to contradiction.

As preliminaries, see that if we choose a prime $p$ such that $u = 2\pi\/p$ and $2^k < p\/4$, then the sequence $\cos 2^n
u$ is periodic, and the period is more than $k$ long (containing at least the distinct values $\cos u, \cos 2u, \ldots, \cos 2^k u$).

If $|P(\cos u)| = 1+\sqrt{3}$, then $P(\cos 2^n u) = 1+\sqrt{3}$ for all $n\geq 1$. But then, according with the above, the value $1+\sqrt{3}$ will be taken more than $k$ times, with arbitrary $k$, hence $P$ is constant (for that value).

If $|P(\cos u)| < 1+\sqrt{3}$, then $\lim_{n\to \infty} P(\cos 2^n u) = 1-\sqrt{3}$. Again, according with the above, since $\cos 2^n u$ is periodic, then $P(\cos 2^{\ell} u) = 1-\sqrt{3}$, for $1\leq \ell \leq k$, with arbitrary $k$, hence $P$ is constant (for that value).

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all polynomials $P(x)$ such that if $u+v$ be a rational number, then $P(u)+P(v)$ be also a rational number.\end{tcolorbox}

Let $a\in\mathbb Q$ : $P(x)+P(a-x)\in\mathbb Q$ $\forall x$ and so $P(x)+P(a-x)=c$ (the only continuous functions from $\mathbb R\to\mathbb Q$ are constant functions) and so $P(x)+P(a-x)=P(0)+P(a)$

So we have $Q(a-x)=Q(a)-Q(x)$ $\forall x$ $\forall a\in\mathbb Q$ where $Q(x)=P(x)-P(0)$

Continuity implies that this equality is true $\forall a$ and we get $Q(x-y)=Q(x)-Q(y)$ $\forall x,y$ 

And so (Cauchy for continuous function) $Q(x)=cx$ and $P(x)=cx+b$

Plugging back in the original problem, we get $c,b\in\mathbb Q$

hence the answer : $P(x)=px+q$ with any $p,q\in\mathbb Q$

	Finite differences make this pretty simple. Let $P_0(x) = P(x)$ and $P_k(x) = P_{k-1}(x+1) - P_{k-1}(x)$. Using induction and the Fibonacci recurrence we quickly deduce that $P_k(n) = F_{n-k}$, when $992 \leq n \leq 1982 - n$. But since $P_0(x)$ is degree $990$, $P_{990}(x)$ is the constant polynomial, with $P_{990}(992) = F_2 = 1$. Then $P_{990}(993) = 2 = F_3 - 1$. Now doing induction on $k$ in the reverse direction, we get that $P_k(1983-k) = F_{1983-2k} - 1$, for $0 \leq k \leq 990$. In particular $P_0(1983) = P(1983) = F_{1983} - 1$, as desired.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all polynomials $f(x)$ with real coefficients for which
\[f(x)f(2x^2) = f(2x^3 + x).\]\end{tcolorbox}
Here is a rather ugly solution. I hope somebody will find a better one.

The only constant solutions are $f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=1$ $\forall x$. Let us from now look for non constant solutions.

Let $P(x)$ be the assertion $f(x)f(2x^2)=f(2x^3+x)$

$P(0)$ $\implies$ $f(0)^2=f(0)$ and so $f(0)=0$ or $f(0)=1$

If $f(0)=0$ : let $f(x)=x^pg(x)$ with $g(0)\ne 0$. The assertio $p(x)$ becomes $2{}^px{}^{3p}g(x)g(2x^2)=x^p(2x^2+1)^pg(2x^3+x)$
and so (remember these are polynomials) : $2{}^px{}^{2p}g(x)g(2x^2)=(2x^2+1)^pg(2x^3+x)$ which is impossible (just set $x=0$ in it)

So $f(0)=1$
It's easy to see that $f(a)=0$ implies $f(2a^3+a)=0$ and so infinitely many roots if $a\ne 0$. So $f(x)$ has no real roots, and so $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$

$P(i)$ $\implies$ $f(i)f(-2)=f(-i)$
$P(-i)$ $\implies$ $f(-i)f(-2)=f(i)$
And so $f(i)f(-2)^2=f(i)$
If $f(-2)^2\ne 1$, this implies $f(i)=f(-i)=0$ and let then $f(x)=(x^2+1)^pg(x)$ with $g(i)\ne 0$
Assertion $P(x)$ becomes $(x^2+1)^p(4x^4+1)^pg(x)g(2x^2)=((2x^3+x)^2+1)^pg(2x^3+x)$ $=(x^2+1)^p(4x^4+1)^pg(2x^3+x)$ and so $g(x)g(2x^2)=g(2x^3+x)$

So any non constant solution may be written as $(x^2+1)^pf(x)$ where $f(x)$ is a solution such that $f(i)\ne 0$
So we got another family of solutions : $(x^2+1)^n$

Let us from now look for non constant solutions $f(x)$ such that $f(i)\ne 0$
$f(i)f(-2)^2=f(i)$ implies then $f(-2)=1$ (since we know that $f(x)>0$ $\forall x$

Let then $x_m$ such that $f(x_m)$ is a global minimum for $f(x)$. We get $f(x_m)\le f(0)=1$

If $f(x_m)=1$, choose $x_m=-2$ and let then $u$ such that $2u^3+u=x_m=-2$. we get $-2<u<0$ and $P(u)$ $\implies$ $f(u)f(2u^2)=f(x_m)=1$ and so $f(u)=f(2u^2)=1$. 
Let then $u_1$ such that $2u_1^3+u_1=u$. We get $u<u_1<0$ and, in the same way, $f(u_1)=1$
And so we can buils infinitely many $u_i$ such that $f(u_i)=1$, which is impossible.

So $f(x_m)<1$ and $x_m\ne 0$
Let then $u\ne 0$ such that $2u^3+u=x_m$ : $P(u)$ $\implies$ $f(u)f(2u^2)=f(x_m)\le\min(f(u),f(2u^2)$ and so $f(u)\le 1$ and $f(2u^2)\le 1$
$P(x_m)$ $\implies$ $f(x_m)f(2x_m^2)=f(2x_m^3+x_m)\ge f(x_m)$ and so $f(2x_m^2)\ge 1$
So $f(2u^2)\le 1$ and $f(2{}_x{}_m^2)\ge 1$ and so $\exists v_1>0$ such that $f(v_1)=1$
Let then $v1> w_1>0$ such that $2w_1^2+w_1=v_1$
$P(w_1)$ $\implies$ $f(w_1)f(2w_1^2)=f(v_1)=1$ 
$v_1=2w_1^3+w_1>2w_1^2$ so that both $w_1$ and $2w_1^2$ are in $(0,v_1)$
And since $f(w_1)f(2w_1^2)=1$, one of the two values is $\ge 1$ and the other is $\le 1$ and so $\exists v_2\in(0,v_1)$ such that $f(v_2)=1$
And so we can build an infinite decreasing sequence of positive real numbers such that $f(v_i)=1$, which is impossible.
And so there are no non constant solutins such that $f(i)\ne 0$

So the only solutions are :
$f(x)=0$
$f(x)=1$
$f(x)=(x^2+1)^n$ with any $n\in\mathbb N$

Setting $x=0$ yields $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$. We claim that if $f(0) = 0$, then $f$ is the zero polynomial. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is not the zero polynomial. Then we may let $f(x) = x^n g(x)$, where $g(0) \neq 0$. It follows that $(2x^3)^n g(x)g(2x^2) = (2x^3 + x)^n g(2x^3 + x)$, so $(2x^2)^n g(x)g(2x^2) = (2x^2 + 1)^n g(2x^3 + x)$. Setting $x = 0$ yields $0 = g(0)$, which is a contradiction. 

We now consider the case in which $f(0) = 1$. We observe that for any solution $h(x)$ to the functional equation, $(x^2+1) h(x)$ is also a solution. Hence, it is sufficient to solve this equation in the case in which $x^2+1$ does not divide $f$. 

We claim that if $x^2+1$ does not divide $f$, then $f$ must be constant. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it is nonconstant. Let its roots be $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_m$, and suppose without loss of generality that $z_1$ is any of the roots with greatest magnitude. Because $f(0) = 1$, by Vieta's formulas $|z_1| |z_2| \cdots |z_m| = 1$. Hence, $|z_1| \geq 1$. 

Setting $x = z_1$ in the equation yields $0 = f(z_1) f(2z_1^2) = f(2z_1^3 + z_1)$, so $2z_1^3 + z_1$ is a root as well. Because $z_1$'s norm is maximal, $|z_1| \geq |2z_1^3 + z_1|$, so $|2z_1^2 + 1| \leq 1$. However, $2 \geq |-2z_1^2 - 1| + |1| \geq |-2z_1^2 - 1 + 1| = 2|z_1|^2 \geq 2$. From the equality case of the triangle inequality, $z_1^2$ must be a negative real. Since $|z_1| = 1$, $z_1^2 = \pm i$. 

Hence, either $i$ or $-i$ must be a root. But if $i$ is a root, then $0 = f(i)f(-2) = f(2i^3 + i) = f(-i)$, and if $-i$ is a root, then $0 = f(-i)f(-2) = f(i)$, so if either $i$ or $-i$ is a root, then both $i$ and $-i$ are roots. This implies that $x^2+1$ is a factor of $f$, which is a contradiction. 

It follows that $f$ is constant. It is easy to conclude from here that the only solutions are $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^n$ for any nonnegative integer $n$.

Plugging this in original equation, we get $f(0)(g(xy)-g(x)g(y))=0$

$f(x^n)=f(x)P_n(x)$ and so $z$ root of $f(x)$ implies $z,z^2,z^3,....$ roots and since $f(x)$ only has two roots, we get either $z^2=z$, either $z^2\ne z$ and $z^3=z$, either $z^2\ne z$ and $z^3=z^2$ and so $z\in\{-1,0,1\}$ and only six possibilities :

roots $0,0$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x^2$ which indeed is a solution
roots $0,1$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x(x-1)$ which indeed is a solution
roots $0,-1$ $\implies$ $f(x)=x(x+1)$ which is not a solution
roots $1,1$ $\implies$ $f(x)=(x-1)^2$ which indeed is a solution

	$f(x)|f(x^2)\implies x^2+ax+b|x^4+ax^2+b$
$x^2+ax+b|(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax-b)=x^4-(ax+b)^2$
So $f(x)|f(x^2)\implies x^2+ax+b|(ax+b)^2+ax^2+b=a(a+1)x^2+2abx+b(b+1)$
$x^2+ax+b|a(a+1)(x^2+ax+b)=a(a+1)x^2+a^2(a+1)x+ab(a+1)$
So $f(x)|f(x^2)\implies x^2+ax+b|(a^2(a+1)x+ab(a+1))-(2abx+b(b+1))=$ $a(a^2+a-2b)x+b(a^2+a-b-1)$
So $a(a^2+a-2b)=b(a^2+a-b-1)=0$

If $a=0$, then $b(b+1)=0$ then $b=0\text{ or }-1$
Then $f(x)=x^2$ which works, or $f(x)=x^2-1$, which also works.
Then $(a, b)=(0,0); (0,-1)$

Otherwise $a\neq 0$ then $2b=a^2+a$ then $(a+1)(a-1)(a+2)=0$
Then $a=1\text{ or } -1\text{ or } -2$
Then $f(x)=x^2+x+1$ which does not work, $f(x)=x^2-x$ which works, or $f(x)=x^2-2x+1$ which also works.

Let $z$ be a root (complex or real) of $f(x)$

If $z=\frac 12$, then $f(x)=(x-\frac 12)g(x)$ and the equation becomes $g(x)=-g(1-x)$ and so $g(\frac 12)=0$ and $g(x)=(x-\frac 12)h(x)$ and so $f(x)=(x^2-x+\frac 14)h(x)$ with $h(x)=h(1-x)$

If $z\ne \frac 12$, then $f(1-z)=0$ with $1-z\ne z$ and $f(x)=(x-z)(x-1+z)h(x)$ $=(x^2-x+z-z^2)h(x)$ with $h(x)=h(1-x)$

And since degree of $h(x)=$ degree of $f(x) - 2$, we finally get a constant $h(x)$ and

Let $g(x)=f(x+\frac{1}{2})$ then $g(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ s.t. $g(x)=f(x+\frac{1}{2})=f(-x+\frac{1}{2})=g(-x)$
So $g$ is an even polynomial, therefore the coefficients of the odd powered terms ($x^1$, $x^3$, ...) in $g(x)$ are zero.
So $g(x)$ is a polynomial in $x^2$,
So let $g(x)=h(x^2)$ where $h$ is a polynomial.
Now for any real number $a$ and function $h$ there exists a functions $k$ s.t. $k(x)=h(x+a)$
We can take $a=\frac{1}{4}$ then $k(x)=h(x+\frac{1}{4})$

Then $f(x)=g(x-\frac{1}{2})=h(x^2-x+\frac{1}{4})=k(x^2-x)=k(x(x-1))$ where $k$ is a polynomial.
So $f(x)$ is a polynomial with respect to $x(x-1),$ as required.

If $P(x)$ is not constant, we get $P(2x)=2P(x)+2x^2$ for any $x$ in some non empty open interval, and so $\forall x\in\mathbb R$

Then, if degree is $>2$, comparaison of higher degrees lead to contradiction ($2^na_n=2a_n$), and so $P(x)=ax^2+bx+c$

   :P\end{tcolorbox}

Looking at highest degrees, we can easily see that $f_k(x)$ have degree at most $1$

So we are looking for rational numbers $a_i$ and $b_i$ such that : $\sum_{k=1}^n (a_ix+b_i)^2=x^2+7$

If $a_n\ne 1$, let $u=\frac {-b_n}{a_n-1}$ so that $u=f_n(u)$ and so $u^2=f_n(u)^2$
If $a_n=1$, let $u=\frac {-b_n}{a_n+1}$ so that $-u=f_n(u)$ and so $u^2=f_n(u)^2$

Setting this value in the identity, we get $7=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} f_k(u)^2$
and so $\exists$ integers $c_k$ and $b$ such that $\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k^2=7b^2$

Writing $b=2^p(2q+1)$, this may be written $\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k^2=4^p(8\frac{7q(q+1)}2+7)$

And it's rather well known (maybe) that numbers if the form $4^n(8m+7)$ cant be written as sum of less than 4 squares (I think this is a Gauss result).

So $n-1\ge 4$ and $n\ge 5$

And since $x^2+7=\left(\frac{3x+2}6\right)^2+$ $\left(\frac{3x-8}6\right)^2+$ $\left(\frac{x-2}2\right)^2+$ $\left(\frac{x+4}2\right)^2+$ $\left(\frac 13\right)^2$, we get the answer :

Google is our friend ... :

It is called the three squares theorem.

Here are two references for proofs (but unfortunately, these are not free access texts) :

Abstract: 
A theorem of Fein, Gordon, and Smith on the representation of -1 as a sum of two squares is shown to yield a new proof of the three squares theorem. A positive integer k can be represented as a sum of three integer squares if and only if k [not equal to] 4an with n [identical to] 7 (mod 8) and a >= 0. This proof depends of the Brauer group and class field theory, not on ternary quadratic forms.

\begin{solution}[by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/48552}{ocha}]
	This turned out to be much harder than i first thought, do you have a nicer solution?

\begin{bolded}Lower Bound:\end{bolded} $f(x)=x^2+(k+1)x+k = (x+1)(x+k)$ gives $n-1$ functions, then because $n\ge 4$ we can include $x^2+4x+3$ and $2x^2+4x+2$ giving $P(n)>n$

\begin{bolded}Upper Bound\end{bolded}: for $n=1$ the claim is trivial. Assume $P(k)<k^2$ then consider $n=k+1$, we examine the cases where at least one of $a,b,c=k+1$. We cannot have $a= k+1$. Write $(a,b,c)=(a,a\cdot (r_1+r_2),a\cdot r_1\cdot r_2)$ where $r_1,r_2$ are the integer roots of $f$, clearly $r_1,r_2$ must be positive integers.

\begin{bolded}1) \end{bolded} First we count the number of solutions to $b=a\cdot (r_1+r_2)=k+1$. 

If $\max\{r_1,r_2\}\ge 2$ we get $c =a\cdot r_1\cdot r_2 \ge a(r_1+r_2)=k+1$ with equality iff $r_1=r_2=2$. Hence the only soutions are $(r_1, r_2, a) = (1,r_2,\textstyle\frac{k+1}{r_2})$ (at most k solutions) or $(2,2, \frac{k+1}{4})$ (1 solution). So there are at most $k+1$ such functions when $b=k+1$

\begin{bolded}2) \end{bolded}
\begin{bolded}Lemma:\end{bolded} For some fixed $n\in \mathbb{N}$, the number of solutions to to $a\cdot b \cdot c = n$ for $(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{N}^3$, with $b\ge c$  is at most $n$. 

[hide="proof "]
============================Proof===================================
Let $n = p_1^{e_1}\cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot \cdot \cdot p_k^{e_k}$ for distinct primes $p_1,...,p_k$ then the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ where we ignore the fact that $b\ge c$ is equal to $\prod_{j=1}^k \binom{e_j+2}{2}$ (*). This is because $\textstyle\binom{e_j+2}{2}$ is the number of ways to distibute $e_j$ copies of prime $p_j$ among $a,b,c$). 

The number of triples $(a,b,c)$ where $b=c$ is given by $\lfloor\frac{e_1}{2}+1\rfloor\cdot\cdot\cdot \lfloor\frac{e_k}{2}+1 \rfloor$. Because we either give no primes, $p_i$, to $b,c$ or give both $b$ and $c$ the sume number of primes, $p_i$. Now it follows that the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ with $b\ge c$ is

\[ \frac{1}{2}(\prod_{j=1}^k \binom{e_j+2}{2} + \lfloor \frac{e_1}{2}+1 \rfloor \cdot \cdot \cdot \lfloor\frac{e_k}{2}+1\rfloor) \qquad (**)\] 

Now we will show that (**) is less that $n$. 

First if all $e_i \le 1$ then ${\lfloor \frac{e_1}{2}+1\rfloor \cdot \cdot \cdot \lfloor\frac{e_k}{2}+1\rfloor})=1$
Now using the fact that $\binom{e_j+2}{2} > 2^{e_j+1}$ and $\binom{e_j+2}{2} \ge p^{e_j}$ where $p$ is a prime greater than $2$. And the fact that $n \ge 2^{e_1}\cdot 3^{e_2} \cdot 5^{e_3}\cdot\cdot\cdot$ If follows from (**) that we must have at most $n$ solutions $(a,b,c)$. Now if any value $e_i$ is increased by one, then $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdot\cdot p_k^{e_k}$ will at least double, while (**) will at most double. Hence $(**)$ is at most $n$
===========================End of Proof========================================
[\/hide]

From the lemma we know that if $c=a\cdot r_1\cdot r_2 = k+1$. then there is at most $k+1$ triples $(a,r_1,r_2)$. But one of these triples is $(k+1,1,1)$ which gives the function $f(x)=(k+1)x^2 + 2(k+1)x + k+1$ but this is not allowed since $2(k+1) > k+1$ hence there are only $k$ such tiples

From (1) and (2) we have at most $2k+1$ functions with at least one of $a,b,c=k+1$. so $P(k+1) \le P(k) + 2k+1 < (k+1)^2$ so we are done. Phhhew!

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all numbers $\alpha$ for which the equation
\[x^2 - 2x[x] + x -\alpha = 0\]
has two nonnegative roots. ($[x]$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.)\end{tcolorbox}
Let $x=n+y$ with $y\in[0,1)$ 

The equation becomes $P(y)=y^2+y-n^2+n-\alpha=0$

If $n+y$ is a solution, we can see that $1-n+y$ is too a solution.
Since we want two nonnegative roots and so no negative roots, this mean $n\in\{0,1\}$ and the two roots are $y$ and $1+y$ with $y^2+y-\alpha=0$ and so we need $2>\alpha\ge 0$

This interval warranties us that we have two nonnegative solutions.
We must now verify that we cant have more.

If we look values of $n$ such that $P(y)=y^2+y-n^2+n-\alpha=0$ has solutions in $[0,1)$, we get :
Discriminant $\ge 0$ 
Than sum of roots is $-1$ and so at least one is negative and so the other must be in $[0,1)$, so $P(0)\le 0$ and $P(1)>0$, so the system :
Discriminant positive : $n^2-n+\frac 14+\alpha>0$ (we discard discriminant $=0$ since then the two roots are $-\frac 12$
$P(0)\le 0$ : $-n^2+n-\alpha\le 0$
$P(1)>0$ : $-n^2+n+2-\alpha>0$

So $n^2-n>-\alpha-\frac 14$ and $n^2-n\ge -\alpha$ and $n^2-n<2-\alpha$

And so $-\alpha\le n^2-n<2-\alpha$

Since we want the only two solutions are $n=0$ and $n=1$, we can check that $\boxed{\alpha\in[0,2)}$ indeed is the solution.

So $P(x)=P(\sqrt{1-x^2})$ $\forall x\in[-1,1]$

Let $P(x)=A(x^2)+xB(x^2)$ where $A,B\in\mathbb R[X]$. We get :

$A(x^2)+xB(x^2)=A(1-x^2)+\sqrt{1-x^2}B(1-x^2)$ and so $B(1-x^2)=0$ $\forall x\in[0,1]$

So $B(x)=0$ and $A(x)=A(1-x)$ and so $A(x)=U(x)+U(1-x)$ for any $U\in \mathbb R[X]$

Hence the result : $P(x)=U(x^2)+U(1-x^2)$ for any $U\in \mathbb R[X]$ which indeed is a solution

Thanks for your solution, but can you explain how did you find out the result above?\end{tcolorbox}
The equation $P(x)=P(1-x)$ is very simple and has different general solutions :

1) $P(x)=A(x)+A(1-x)$
The fact that $A(x)+A(1-x)$ is a solution is trivial 
The fact that any solution may be put in this form is trivial too : just choose $A(x)=\frac 12P(x)$

2) $P(x)=A((x-\frac 12)^2)$
Let $Q(x)=P(x+\frac 12)$ and the equation becomes $Q(x-\frac 12)=Q(\frac 12-x)$ and so $Q(x)$ even
And so $Q(x)=A(x^2)$
And so $P(x)=A((x-\frac 12)^2)$

3) $P(x)=A(x-\frac 12)+A(\frac 12-x)$
This is due to the fact that another general solution of $Q(x)$ even is $A(x)+A(-x)$

and so on ...

	\begin{tcolorbox}let n be a positive integer find the number of all polynomials with integer coefficient from the set{0,1,2,3} and for which P(2)=n\end{tcolorbox}
Let $K=\{0,1\}[X]$ the set of polynomials whose coefficients are in $\{0,1\}$
Let $L=\{0,1,2,3\}[X]$ the set of polynomials whose coefficients are in $\{0,1,2,3\}$

Let $P(x)\in L$
Let $P(x)=A_0(x)+A_1(x)+2A_2(x)+3A_3(x)$ where $A_i(x)\in K$ is the polynomial made of sum of powers of $x$ whose coefficient is $i$.

Let then $U(x)=A_0(x)+A_1(x)+A_3(x)$ and $V(x)=A_2(x)+A_3(x)$ so that $P(x)=U(x)+2V(x)$ with $U,V\in K$

The application $f$ from $K\to\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ such that $f(P)=P(2)$ is a bijection.

So the question is to count the number of couples $(a,b)$ where $a,b\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ such that $a+2b=n$

	Possibility 1
We write the polynomial $P(x)$ as:
\[P(x)=x^{5}-nx-n-2=(x-a)(x^{4}+bx^{3}+cx^{2}+dx+e)\]
For $x=a$ is:
\[P(a)=a^{5}-na-n-2=0\]
\[a^{5}-na=n+2\]
\[a(a^{4}-n)=n+2\]
If $a^{4}-n=e$, then $a\cdot e=n+2$
\[ \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{4}-n=e}\\ {a\cdot e=n+2}\end{array}\right. \Rightarrow
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{4}-e=n}\\ {a\cdot e=n+2}\end{array}\right. \]
Subtracting:
\[a^{4}-e-a\cdot e=-2\]
or\[a^{4}-a\cdot e=e-2\]and \[a(a^{3}-e)=e-2\]

If $a^{3}-e=l$, then $a\cdot l=e-2$
\[ \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{3}-e=l}\\ {a\cdot l=e-2}\end{array}\right. \Rightarrow
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{3}-l=e}\\ {a\cdot l=e-2}\end{array}\right. \]
Subtracting:
\[a^{3}-l-a\cdot l=2\]
or\[a^{3}-a\cdot l=l+2\]and \[a(a^{2}-l)=l+2\]

If $a^{2}-l=t$, then $a\cdot t=l+2$
\[ \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{2}-l=t}\\ {a\cdot t=l+2}\end{array}\right. \Rightarrow
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a^{2}-t=l}\\ {a\cdot t=l+2}\end{array}\right. \]
Subtracting:
\[a^{2}-t-a\cdot t=-2\]
or\[a^{2}-a\cdot t=t-2\]and \[a(a-t)=t-2\]

If $a-t=z$, then $a\cdot z=t-2$
\[ \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a-t=z}\\ {a\cdot z=t-2}\end{array}\right. \Rightarrow
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}{a-z=t}\\ {a\cdot z=t-2}\end{array}\right. \]
Subtracting:
\[a-z-a\cdot z=2\]
or\[a-a\cdot z=z+2\]and \[a(1-z)=z+2\]

Finally
\[a=\frac{z+2}{1-z}\]
We know that a,n,e,l,t and z are integers
The only integer solutions (z,a) are: (-2,0), (0,2), (2,-4) and (4,-2)
We find for a: 2,  -2,  -4 and for n: 10, 34, 342
\[P(x)=x^{5}-10x-12=(x-2)(x^{4}+2x^{3}+4x^{2}+8x+6)\]
\[P(x)=x^{5}-34x-36=(x+2)(x^{4}-2x^{3}+4x^{2}-8x-18)\]
\[P(x)=x^{5}-342x-344=(x+4)(x^{4}-4x^{3}+16x^{2}-64x-86)\]
Possibility  2
We write the polynomial $P(x)$ as:
\[P(x)=x^{5}-nx-n-2=(x^{2}+ax+b)(x^{3}+cx^{2}+dx+e)\]
\[P(x)=x^{5}+(a+c)x^{4}+(ac+b+d)x^{3}+(ad+bc+e)x^{2}+(ae+bd)x+be\]
We substitute $c=-a$:
\[P(x)=x^{5}-(a^{2}-b-d)x^{3}+(ad-ab+e)x^{2}+(ae+bd)x+be\]
We substitute $d=a^{2}-b$
\[P(x)=x^{5}+(a^{3}-2ab+e)x^{2}+(a^{2}b+ae-b^{2})x+be\]
At last: $e=a(2b-a^{2}$
\[P(x)=x^{5}-(a^{4}-3a^{2}b+b^{2})x-ab(a^{2}-2b)\]
Because $P(x)=x^{5}-nx-n-2$, is:
\[a^{4}-3a^{2}b+b^{2}=n and ab(a^{2}-2b)=n+2\]
Subtracting:
\[a^{4}-3a^{2}b+b^{2}-ab(a^{2}-2b)=-2\]
It's a quadratic equation in b;
\[(2a+1)b^{2}-(a+3)a^{2}b+a^{4}+2=0\]
The only integer solution is $a=-1$, $b=-3$ and $n=19$:
\[P(x)=x^{5}-19x-21=(x^{2}-x-3)(x^{3}+x^{2}+4x+7)\]

$W(r)|2^r-1$ and $r$ is order of 2 mod $W(r)$.  We know $W(r+W(r))$ is divisible by $W(r)$. So $W(r)|2^{r+W(r)}-1$. It means $r|W(r)$ and that is contradiction with $r>|a_0|$.

	Let $f(x)=x^4-8x^3-8x$. If $x$ is integer, $f(x)$ is integer too, Therefore $k$ is integer. 
$f(0)=0,f(1)=-15,f(2)=-64,f(3)=-159,f(4)=-288,f(5)=-415,f(6)=-480,f(7)=-399,f(8)=-64.f(9)=659$ $f(x)$ increase, when $x>8$ and decrease, when $x<0$. Therefore $f(a)=f(b)\to a<0, b>8$. We can take $a=-m,b=m+b,m>0,b>0$. Obviosly $b$ must be even and $b\not =0$, because $f(-m)>f(m),m>0$.
It gives $m^4+8m^3+8m=m^4+(4b-8)m^3+6b(b-4)m^2+4(b^3-6b^2-2)m+b^4-8b^3-8b$ or
(1) $4(b-4)m^3+6b(b-4)m^2+4(b^3-6b^2-4)m+b^4-8b^3-8b=0.$
If $b\ge 10$ equation (1) had not positive root.
$b=8$ $16m^3+192m^2+496m-64=0$ had not integer solution.
$b=6$ $8m^3+72m^2-16m-480=0$ - had not integer solution.
$b=4$ $-144m-288=0$ had not positive integer solution.
$b=2$ $-8m^3-24m^2-80m-64$ had not positive integer solution.
Therefore never $f(a)=f(b)$ for different integers $a,b$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}find all values of $k$ for which the equation

$x^4 - 8 x^3 - 8x = k$ has at least 2 integer roots.\end{tcolorbox}
So $x^4-8x^3-8x-k=(x-m)(x-n)(x^2+ax+b)$ with $m,n\in\mathbb Z$ and $a,b\in\mathbb R$ 

Let $s=m+n$ and $p=mn$ : $x^4-8x^3-8x-k=(x^2-sx+p)(x^2+ax+b)$ and so :

$a-s=-8$
$b+p-as=0$
$ap-bs=-8$
Taking $a=s-8$ from the first equation, we get :

$b+p-s(s-8)=0$
$p(s-8)-bs=-8$
Taking $b=s(s-8)-p$ from the first equation, we get : $p(s-8)-s^2(s-8)+ps=-8$ $\iff$ $s^3-8s^2-2ps+8p-8=0$

So $s=2t$ and $2t^3-8t^2-pt+2p-2=0$
$t=0$ and $p=1$ is a solution and so $m,n$ roots of $x^2+1=0$, impossible. So $t\ne 0$ and $t|2(p-1)$

1) If $t=2r$ is even : $8r^3-16r^2-pr+p-1=0$

So $p=ru+1$ and the equation is $8r^2-16r-(ru+1)+u=0$ 
It's easy to check that $r=1$ is not a solution and so $u=\frac{8r^2-16r-1}{r-1}=8r-8-\frac 9{r-1}$
So $r-1|9$ and $r\in\{-8,-2,2,4,10\}$ :
$r=-8$ gives $u=-71$ and $p=569$ and $s=-32$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2+32x+569=0$ and so no solution
$r=-2$ gives $u=-21$ and $p=43$ and $s=-8$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2+8x+43=0$ and so no solution
$r=2$ gives $u=-1$ and $p=-1$ and $s=8$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-8x-1=0$ and so no solution
$r=4$ gives $u=21$ and $p=85$ and $s=16$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-16x+85=0$ and so no solution
$r=10$ gives $u=71$ and $p=711$ and $s=40$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-40x+711=0$ and so no solution

2) If $t$ is odd, then $p=tu+1$ and the equation is $2t^2-8t-tu+2u-1=0$
It's easy to check that $t=2$ is not a solution and so $u=\frac{2t^2-8t-1}{t-2}=2t-4-\frac 9{t-2}$
So $t-2|9$ and $t\in\{-7,-1,1,3,5,11\}$ :
$r=-7$ gives $u=-17$ and $p=120$ and $s=-14$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2+14x+120=0$ and so no solution
$r=-1$ gives $u=-3$ and $p=4$ and $s=-2$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2+2x+4=0$ and so no solution
$r=1$ gives $u=7$ and $p=8$ and $s=2$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-2x+8=0$ and so no solution
$r=3$ gives $u=-7$ and $p=-20$ and $s=6$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-6x-20=0$ and so no solution
$r=5$ gives $u=3$ and $p=16$ and $s=10$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-10x+16=0$ and so the solution $(m,n)=(2,8)$
$r=11$ gives $u=17$ and $p=188$ and $s=22$ and $m,n$ roots of $x^2-22x+188=0$ and so no solution

Hence the unique solution $(x-2)(x-8)(x^2+2x+4)=x^4-8x^3-8x+64$ and so $\boxed{k=-64}$

Adding the three equalities, we get $(a+b+c)(k^2-k-1)=0$

1) $a+b+c=0$
The system is then :
$ak^2-bk+a+b=0$
$bk^2+(a+b)k-b=0$

eliminating $k^2$ between these two lines we get $(a^2+ab+b^2)(k-1)=0$
$k=1$ would imply $a=b=0$, impossible ($a,b,c$ are non zero)

So $a^2+ab+b^2=0$,impossible too if $a,b$ are non zero.

2) $k^2-k-1=0$
The system is then :
$k^2=k+1$
$(a-b)k+(a-c)=0$
$(b-c)k+(b-a)=0$

And so $(a-c)(b-c)=(b-a)(a-b)$ $\iff$ $(2a-b-c)^2+3(b-c)^2=0$ and so $2a=b+c$ and $b-c=0$ and so $a=b=c$

	If we let $P_1(\alpha)=P_2(\alpha)=P_3(\alpha)$, we get
\[px^2-qx-r=0; qx^2-rx-p=0; rx^2-px-q=0\]
to have a common real root $\alpha$ where $p=a-b; q=b-c; r=c-a$.
If $a=b$, then some manipulating gives $b=c$ and we are done.
If we let $p, q, r\neq 0$, we have
\[x^2-\frac{q}{p}x-\frac{r}{p}=0\]
If this equations's roots are $\alpha, \alpha_1$, we get $\alpha+\alpha_1-\alpha\alpha_1=\frac{q}{p}+\frac{r}{p}=1$ and so, $(\alpha-1)(\alpha_1-1)=2$.
If the roots of
\[x^2-\frac{r}{q}x-\frac{p}{q}=0\]
are $\alpha, \alpha_2$, we have $(\alpha-1)(\alpha_2-1)=2$ which forces $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$
So, 
\[px^2-qx-r\equiv qx^2-rx-p\equiv rx^2-px-q=\]
\[\Longrightarrow p:q:r=-q:-r:-p=-r:-p:-q\]

Alright, let me post my proof to it, which I provided during the exam.
Denote
$Q_1(x)=P_1(x)-P_2(x)=(a-b)x^2-(b-c)x-(c-a);$
$Q_2(x)=P_2(x)-P_3(x)=(b-c)x^2-(c-a)x-(a-b);$
$Q_3(x)=P_3(x)-P_1(x)=(c-a)x^2-(a-b)x-(b-c).$
Then $\alpha$ is a real root of the equations $Q_i(x);$ so that $\Delta_{Q_i(x)}\geq 0 \ \ \forall i=1,2,3;$ where $\Delta_{f(x)}$ denoted the discriminant of a quadratic function $f$ in $x.$
Now, using this we have,
$(b-c)^2+4(a-b)(c-a)\geq 0;$
$(c-a)^2+4(a-b)(b-c)\geq 0;$
$(a-b)^2+4(b-c)(c-a)\geq 0.$
Summing these up and using the identity
$\begin{aligned}(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2+2\sum_{cyc}(a-b)(c-a)\\=[(a-b)+(b-c)+(c-a)]^2=0;\end{aligned}$
We obtain,
$\begin{aligned}0&\leq 2\sum_{cyc}(a-b)(c-a)=2\sum_{cyc}(ca+ab-bc-a^2)\\&=-\left[(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2\right];\end{aligned}$
Possible if and only if $(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2=0\iff a=b=c.$ We are done. $\Box$

Suppose there exists a real number $\alpha$ such that $P_1(\alpha) = P_2(\alpha)= P_3(\alpha)$, then prove that $a=b=c$.\end{tcolorbox}
Well, my proof seemed different from the rest, so I'm posting.
Suppose, to the contrary, that not all of $a,b,c$ are equal.
Now, note that $\alpha$ cannot be $0$, as that would directly imply all of them being equal.
Therefore, $\alpha \not = 0$. Now, assume $a \ge b \ge c$ without loss of generality due to symmetry.
Finally, if $\alpha < 0$, then 
\[P_1(\alpha)= a\alpha^2-b\alpha-c > b\alpha^2-c\alpha-b=P_2(\alpha).\]
(Note that we put the strictly greater than sign because equality cannot hold.)
And, if $\alpha > 0$, then
\[P_1(\alpha)= a\alpha^2-b\alpha-c > cx^2-a\alpha-b = P_3(\alpha)\]
(Again, equality cannot hold.)

Thus, $\alpha$ is rendered hopeless :D , and we're done!

(It can be made more intuitive by adding symbols, $p (=a-b) ,q (=b-c)$ and noting that our assumption implies $p+q>0$. That's the way I did it in the exam.)

$a(\alpha	)^2>=b(\alpha	)^2>=c(\alpha	)^2$ 
$-c(\alpha)>=-b(\alpha)>=-a(\alpha)$ 
 $-c>=-b>=-a$
lets consider $p1(x)$ and $p3(x)$
$a(\alpha )^2>=c(\alpha	)^2$
$-b(\alpha)>=-a(\alpha)$
$-c>=-b$
this implies $p1(\alpha)>=p3(\alpha)$ and equality holds when $a=b=c $

	Two problems with that approach.  First, you don't know that $a\geq b\geq c$; you can only assume that $a\geq b, c$, because $a\geq b\geq c$ is a different case from $a\geq c\geq b$.

Second, you assume that $\alpha\geq0$, when you say $-b\alpha\geq-a\alpha$, but of course that doesn't have to be true either.

I think you could work out these two problems by breaking it into cases, but as it stands, your proof is not complete.

Because we only know that $p_1(k)=p_2(k)=p_3(k)$ for \begin{bolded}some\end{bolded} real number $k$. If we wanted to equate the coefficients, we needed to know that they were equal as \begin{italicized}polynomials\end{italicized}.
For example, $p_1(x)=2x^2+x+1,\ p_2(x)=x^2+2x+1,$ and $p_3(x)=x^2+x+2$ are not all equal, but $p_1(1)=p_2(1)=p_3(1)$.

	Ok, So sorry for reviving this thread...
But I just got another approach, 

My proof:
Consider  Equations $(a-b)(\alpha )^2+(c-b)(\alpha )+a-c=0 $ and $(b-c)(\alpha )^2+(a-c)(\alpha )+b-a=0$ Which are true from given data.
We multiply equation $1$ by $(a-c)$ and equation $2$ by $(c-b)$ assuming $a,b,c$ are not equal.
Subtracting the equations we get $ (\alpha )^2=\frac{yz-x^2}{xz+y^2} $ 
where $x=(a-c), y=(b-c), z=(a-b)$
And we know $x=y+z$ 
From this result we end up getting that $ yz-x^2<0 $ and $xz+y^2>0$ 
which implies $(\alpha )^2<0$ which is a contradiction since it is given to be real. 
Therefore we conclude $a=b=c$

	\begin{tcolorbox}\begin{bolded}Hello ...\end{bolded}  :) 

Find all polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $f(x)f(-x)=f(x^2)$\end{tcolorbox}
Constant solutions are $f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=1$

Let then $u$ root of a non constant solution : $u^2$ is root too and so the only non zero complex roots need to have $|u|=1$ (else we would have infinitely many roots).

Let us consider then all the roots $\notin\{0,1\}$ :  $e^{ia_n}$ with $a_n\in[-\pi,\pi)\setminus\{0\}$
If this set is non empty, let $a$ one $a_n$ whose absolute value is minimum.

$f(e^{ia})=f(e^{i\frac {a}2})f(e^{-i\frac {a}2})$ and so either $e^{i\frac {a}2}$ is a root, either $e^{-i\frac {a}2}$ is a root, in contradiction with the choice of $a$.

So the only possible roots are $0$ and $1$ and $f(x)=ax^p(x-1)^q$ and so, plugging this in original equation, we get :

$a=a^2(-1)^{p+q}$ and so $a=(-1)^{p+q}$

Hence the solutions :
$f(x)=0$
$f(x)=(-x)^p(1-x)^q$ for any $p,q$ non negative integers (and $p=q=0$ gives the solution $f(x)=1$)

Hence all roots lie at the origin or on the unit circle $0,1$ and third roots of unity have the closure property for squaring . Hence $x^p(x-1)^q(1+x+x^2)^r$ also has the closure property . Inserting into the functional equation , we see that , in addition ,  $p+q$ must be even :
$f(x)=x^p(x-1)^q(1+x+x^2)^r$ , $p,q,r \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ , $p+q \equiv 0$ mod $2$
\end{solution}

	\begin{tcolorbox}...
$f(e^{ia})=f(e^{i\frac {a}2})f(e^{-i\frac {a}2})$ and so either $e^{i\frac {a}2}$ is a root, either $e^{-i\frac {a}2}$ is a root, in contradiction with the choice of $a$.
...\end{tcolorbox}

Here was my error :oops: : It should be $f(e^{ia})=f(e^{i\frac {a}2})f(-e^{i\frac {a}2})$ ....

	Find all real polynomials $f$ and $g$, such that:
\[(x^2+x+1)\cdot f(x^2-x+1)=(x^2-x+1)\cdot g(x^2+x+1), \]
for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}Find all real polynomials $f$ and $g$, such that:
\[(x^2+x+1)\cdot f(x^2-x+1)=(x^2-x+1)\cdot g(x^2+x+1), \]
for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.\end{tcolorbox}
$x^2+x+1|g(x^2+x+1)$ and so $g(x)=xg_1(x)$
$x^2-x+1|f(x^2-x+1)$ and so $f(x)=xf_1(x)$

And we get $f_1(x^2-x+1)=g_1(x^2+x+1)$

From this equation, setting $x\to -1-x$, we get :
$f_1(x^2+3x+3)=g_1(x^2+x+1)=f_1(x^2-x+1)$ and so :
$f_1((x+\frac 32)^2+\frac 34)=f_1((x-\frac 12)^2+\frac 34)$

Setting $h(x)=f_1((x-\frac 12)^2+\frac 34)$, this may be written $h(x+2)=h(x)$ and so $h(x)$ is a periodic polynomial, so is constant, and so $f_1(x)$ is constant and $g_1(x)$ is constant.

Plugging this in original equation, we get $\boxed{f(x)=g(x)=ax}$
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[Posted by \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/63660}{Victory.US}]
	Determine all polynomials $P$ for which
\[P(x)^2-2=4P(x^2-4x+1)\]
holds for all $x \in \mathbb R$.

	\begin{tcolorbox}determine all polynomial P for which:
$P(x)^2-2=4P(x^2-4x+1)$\end{tcolorbox}
Constant solutions are $P(x)=2-\sqrt 6$ and $P(x)=2+\sqrt 6$

If it exists solution with degree $>0$, let $P(x)$ be one of these non constant solutions with fewest degree.

The equation may be written $P(x)^2-2=4P((x-2)^2-3)$ $\iff$ $P(x+2)^2-2=4P(x^2-3)$
Setting $P_1(x)=P(x+2)$, this gives $P_1(x)^2-2=4P_1(x^2-5)$ and so $P_1(x)^2=P_1(-x)^2$ and $P_1$ is either odd, either even.

1) If $P_1(x)$ is odd :
Let $x\in\[-5,+5]$ : 
$P_1(\sqrt{x+5})^2-2=4P_1(x)$ and so $P_1(x)\ge -\frac 12$ and, since odd : $\frac 12\ge P_1(x)\ge -\frac 12$
So $P_1(x)^2\le\frac 14$ and $P_1(x)^2-2\le-\frac 74$ and so $P_1(x^2-5)\le -\frac 7{16}$ $\forall x\in[-5,+5]$
But this is impossible since, setting $x=\sqrt 5$ this would mean $P_1(0)<0$, which is impossible for an odd polynomial.
So $P_1(x)$ is not odd

2) is $P_1(x)$ is even :
$P_1(x)=Q(x^2)$ and the equation is $Q(x^2)^2-2=4Q((x^2-5)^2)$ and so $Q(x)^2-2=4Q((x-5)^2)$
Let then $R(x)=Q(x+3)$. The equation becomes $R(x-3)^2-2=4R((x-5)^2-3)$ $\iff$ $R(x)^2-2=4R(x^2-4x+1)$

And so $R(x)$ is also a solution, whose degree is less than degree of $P(x)$, and so must be constant, and so is $P(x)$


So we got only two solutions : $\boxed{P(x)=2-\sqrt 6}$ and $\boxed{P(x)=2+\sqrt 6}$
\end{solution}
